Here’s an interesting new article from Ethan Marcotte, in which he muses on better ways to think about Design Systems based on his recent experience.

> Once you’ve identified the root causes, you’ll be in a far, far better place to choose the right things — and, more importantly, to create a system that finally supports your design.

Here’s what I took from it:

We can consider the difference between _things_, _issues_ and _broader goals_.

It’s easy to focus on the _things_ (design tokens, choice of design tool, programming language).

But things are just elements of the system; they don’t _solve_ design systems.

Focusing too much or too early on the _things_ leads to a tendency to _patch_ problems.

Whereas discussing the current wider organisational issues we need to address leads to defining broader goals.

This in turn helps us choose and focus on the _right things_ for the right reasons.
