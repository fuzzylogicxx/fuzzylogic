Trys shows us how to use the Nunjucks `macro` to create encapsulated components. This works out less leaky and more predictable than an `include` preceded by variables set with `set`.

Trysâ€™s solution allows us to render components like so:

<figure>
  
``` twig
{{ component('button', {
  text: 'Press me'
}) }}

{# Output #}
<button type="button">Press me</button>
```

</figure>
