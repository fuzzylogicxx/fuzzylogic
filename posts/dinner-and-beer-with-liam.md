Nice to see and chat with Liam, there. 

Things continue to go pretty smoothly for both of us since we sought new adventures back in 2019 after running a business together.

We talked a bit of work stuff, a bit of family and a bit of music. 

We had dinner at [Sugo](https://www.sugopasta.co.uk/) which was tasty if a tad hurried, then a beer at The Horseshoe Bar. Liam tells me he’s holding out for an invite to listen to some records at mine, so we’ll need to make that happen sometime!
