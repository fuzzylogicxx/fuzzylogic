Clair and I loved this story of Viggo Mortensen’s Ben Cash and family temporarily leaving their off-grid existence in the Pacific Northwest to enter civilisation. It poses some interesting questions about parenting, lifestyle and morality but mainly, it’s just a lot of fun.

Judging by his movie review for The Guardian, [Mark Kermode seemed to like Captain Fantastic too](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/captain-fantastic-review-viggo-mortensen).
