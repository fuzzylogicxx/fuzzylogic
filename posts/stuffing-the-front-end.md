Here’s Bridget Stewart, a developer from Ohio, with some thoroughly enjoyable “curmudgeonly” thoughts on why your website doesn’t necessarily need a Javascript framework.

With websites taking a median time of 5.8 seconds to show primary content (source: HTTPArchive) and Google warning us that 53% of mobile visits leave pages that take longer than three seconds to load, it’s hard to justify stuffing the front-end unnecessarily.

Bridget’s article also contains this quote which I love:

<blockquote>
  <p>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.</p>
  <footer>— John Johnson</footer>
</blockquote>

Essentially, `don’t select the tooling first`—a [principle I fully endorse](https://fuzzylogic.me/thoughts/website-delivery-principles).
