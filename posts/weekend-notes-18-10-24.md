That was a productive and fun weekend. 

On Friday, Clair was meeting her mum and cousin in town so I ordered a Kebabish (fish tikka and mutter pilau rice – banging) and watched episode 4 of the _The Penguin_. 

I started Saturday with a short Rudy-walk then it was off to Pete’s for some table-tennis practice. I’ve been playing crap recently and wanted to fix things. Pete was as generous as ever with his tips, and his advice on “the triangle” and "dialling up/down power" was really effective! By the end I was playing both forehand and backhand much better.  After this I drove out to Kirky and collected my brother Martin to go for a chat over lunch at Nonna’s Kitchen. On the way home we popped into my niece Chloe’s new house and I enjoyed chasing wee Leo around his garden. At night Clair and I stayed in and watched _Where the Crawdads Sing_ which was enjoyable enough. 

On Sunday night I caught up with Mick M and, after a beer at [Shilling](https://shillingbrewingcompany.co.uk/) and food at [Rosa’s Thai](https://rosasthai.com/locations/rosas-thai-restaurant-delivery-takeaway-glasgow) we went to see [Skinshape](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3395378-Skinshape) performing at Room Two. The music was great and the bassist was particularly impressive. I just think Will could do with belting the vocals out a tad louder. My favourite moment was hearing [The Longest Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rtSL-QOTik) live.
