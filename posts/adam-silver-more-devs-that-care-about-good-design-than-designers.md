A spicy but somewhat relatable thought from Adam Silver:

> UX observation: I think there might be more devs who care about good design than there are designers. By “good” I mean works for everyone (is accessible) rather than looks nice. What do you think?

The ensuing conversation is pretty interesting. I particularly liked these contributions from [Martin Hoyer](https://twitter.com/martynhoyer):

> Absolutely. Thinking about the design code-first and understanding how HTML works is so valuable. I don’t think designers should learn HTML but they shouldn’t be the first people to decide how something is built!

He goes on to describe how he thinks design _should_ be done as follows:

> In an ideal world (and I don’t think I’ve ever fully achieved this) I’d like to get some requirements (from product I guess), build a prototype in code, then collaboratively iterate on the design from there. Maybe call it a design sprint or whatever!
