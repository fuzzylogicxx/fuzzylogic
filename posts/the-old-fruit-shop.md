Clair and I just had paid a visit to a relatively new local eatery, [The Old Fruit Shop](https://www.theoldfruitshop.co.uk). And it lived up to expectations. Given the date (it’s St Patrick’s Day tomorrow) they were offering _The Irishman_ as a breakfast special so I plumped for that and it was delicious – especially the black pudding. They also do a nice line in coffees (their house coffee is Thomson’s TEAM) and cakes. With bridies, pies and lots of lovely wines and spirits on display too there’s definitely more to explore – maybe in the evening next time. I also loved the location near Linn Park at Snuffmill Bridge, the cosy interior and the friendly service. I’ll be back!
