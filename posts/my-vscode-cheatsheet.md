Here’s a list of useful (Mac-based) VS Code tips for my reference and yours.
---

## Settings

My preferences:

- "explorer.compactFolders": false
- "explorer.autoReveal": false

## Open current terminal directory in VS Code

<figure>
  
```bash
code .
```

</figure>

## Toggle Terminal

<kbd>Ctrl-`</kbd>

## Toggle sidebar visibility

<kbd>Command-B</kbd>

## Edit multiple rows simultaneously

Select one instance of the text that appears in multiple locations. Use <kbd>Command-D</kbd> to select all, then edit.

## Open file to side (for side-by-side editing)

<kbd>Option–click</kbd> on a file in the Explorer.

## Use the Command Palette

<kbd>Command-Shift-P</kbd>

Then type your search term, for example “workspace settings”.
