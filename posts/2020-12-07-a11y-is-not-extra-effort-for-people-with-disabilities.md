Strong agree with these sentiments regarding accessibility expressed by Max Böck and Andrey Okonetchnikov on Twitter.

From Andrey:

> If you’re building UI, it’s your responsibility to make it work for everyone. Clients often tell me “we don’t care about accessibility” but in reality they do want keyboard support at the very least. So I just build my UI in a way it works without discussing it. It’s my job.

To which Max replies:

> This. A11y is not “extra effort for people with disabilities”, it‘s just part of a well-crafted UI.

Couldn’t agree more, fellas.
