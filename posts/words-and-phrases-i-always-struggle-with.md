I’m not sure if it‘s just me, but there are certain words and phrases which—no matter how many times I look up—just seem to be beyond me! So I’ve decided to note their meanings for future reference. Hopefully this might help make the meanings stick.

Hubris
: excessive pride or self-confidence

Pathos
: a quality (e.g. of a person) that evokes pity or sadness. For example an actor might inject pathos into a character.

Single point of failure
: a part of a system that, if it fails, the whole system fails. It’s a bad thing.
