7 nights at Désir de Provence (hosts Sylvie and Igor), Sarrians, France.

First day (Sat)

Arrive after delays and Europcar racket
Best hosts!
night dinner (booked by Sylvie) – La Bastide Bleue restaurant, Séguret. Beautiful outdoor garden/courtyard setting, lovely food. We learned “squid” either that night or the next. Practiced a little French as they didn’t speak much English which was refreshing!
Beaut setting, and light and countryside
Saumon, beef, chocolat, assiete de fromage

Next morning, Sun
