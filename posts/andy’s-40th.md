Clair and I just had a brilliant night at our friend’s 40th. It was held in the upstairs function room (The Old Burnt Barns) at Lynch’s Bar on London Road, Glasgow – just next to the Barras market. I didn’t know the venue before but it’s great – cool interior and loads of space.

It was a tonic to see so many familiar faces. I worked with Andy at Bright Signals a few years back and lots of the crew were in attendance including Pete, Woody, Oli B and Andrew M. 

Among my music buddies present were Jamie T, the Radio Magnetic stalwarts Dougal P, Vic and Davie, and lots of the Stirling crew – Robert, Jamie, Julie, Ciaran, Matt. Always great to catch up.

We also got to spend time with Martin E and Izzie. I even made new friends, including Wendy T. While I was complementing her on not leaving the dancefloor we realised we could not only Andy but also Gav S from Edinburgh among our mutual friends. 

I also really enjoyed the chance to DJ again, and got to do this alongside pals like Craigy Moog and Ragnar. I played two sets. One at the start where I got to play records like [Komiko](https://youtu.be/Pu2xRLDe2MM?si=UtQhHkADPMZWAg_E), [Dayton](https://youtu.be/DgoTdg25COQ?si=UPVLGdVA_FutJDg0), A Certain Ratio’s [Constant Curve](https://youtu.be/zuxvQmL2ILg?si=cFwpJY0Wt-vnVAHI) and Krush’s House Arrest. There was one pretty comical moment. Asked around 8pm by Andy’s sister to play Stevie Wonder’s _Happy Birthday_ while they brought out the birthday cake, I had to tell them I couldn’t… because all the DJs had been warned explicitly by Andy not to play it! She gave me a weary look that said “Yep, that sounds like Andy” and we found another way.

In my second set, a back-to-back with Ragnar, I got to play [Mr K’s edit of Thelma Houston](https://youtu.be/Mj5zFwy1laI?si=8OAQiQ9TkQfGbbJ7), [Southern Freeez](https://youtu.be/6Dla9xLIkfQ?si=LQCL17BLw8GBiRIO) (much to Robert’s delight), Sylvester and closed with one of my all-time favourite house records, Mike Delgado’s [Jazz Works](https://youtu.be/UXkpp48Otmc?si=NQJ5TgcLzpMmvJw7).

We shared a cab with Ragnar and Solveig to grab a brief nightcap at Andy’s place, but even still managed to get home at a reasonable time (despite Martin and Izzie’s best attempts to steal our taxi). I’d managed to exercise a few senseible tactics, like starting with non-alcoholic drinks, and that served me well on the night and the next day.

Cracking night, and Andy seemed to really enjoy it. Here’s to your health and happiness, chief.
