BS crew pete

Played two sets. One at the start where I got to play Komiko, Dayton, A Certain Ratio’s “Constant Curve” and Krush’s House Arrest. Asked by Andys sister to play Stevie Wonder’s while they brought a cake happy birthday but had to tell them I was warned explicitly not to play it!

second set where i played Mr K edit, Freeeze and Sylvester much to Roberts and the Stirling crew’s delight and delgado jazz works.

Even managed to head home at a reasonable time (despite Martin and Izzie’s best attempts to steal our taxi)

It was great to see everyone. I really enjoyed all the DJs’ different tunes. Us old heads have still got it!
