Fair play, Jeff – once this interview gets going it’s pretty damn good.
---

Amongst other ground, it covers:

* The technique of “Subtraction”;
* the last quarter of records being the best;
* the bar for electronic music being set too low;
* the complexity of the art form of DJing; and
* thinking about other things while DJing in front of 2000 people…

Plenty of good bits to chew over!
