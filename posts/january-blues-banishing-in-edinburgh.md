I’m starting 2024 as I mean to continue – by seeing and hanging out with friends more often. Yesterday [Tom](https://tomchurchill.com/) and I had a great day moseying around Edinburgh.

After meeting at Waverley and grabbing a quick coffee and bite, we headed to the Scottish National Gallery on The Mound. Tom was keen to see the [Turner watercolours exhibition](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/turner-january) which is on every January. I probably wouldn’t have visited this if not prompted but I’m glad I did. Of the various works on display my favourite were perhpaps [The Falls of Clyde](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/19242?collection=46&artwork=37) and [Lake Albano](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/19238?collection=46&artwork=10).

From there we made the short walk to Cockburn Street and into an old haunt, [Underground Solush’n](https://undergroundsolushn.com/), for some record shopping. I got a few, with the pick being the album [Flying Wig by Devendra Banhart](https://devendrabanhart.bandcamp.com/album/flying-wig).

Next stop was St Andrew’s Square for a saunter around the menswear floor in Harvey Nichols. Neither of us were in the market for anything in particular but nevertheless it was nice to browse their sale including coats by Copenhagen-based brand [NN.07](https://www.nn07.com/en/uk/).

We hopped on an Edinburgh tram outside (first time for both of us) headed for Port of Leith.
