February ‘20 proved to be a challenging month on a number of fronts. As if storms [Ciara](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51436720) and [Dennis](https://youtu.be/XoPiZEmttwg) weren’t enough to contend with, life chucked in some additional turbulence just for good measure.

So with nothing else for it than to batten down the hatches, I reached for some immersive ambience, restorative reggae and mood-enhancing electronics to help weather the storm.

As it turns out, records _really are_ good for the soul and the forecast now looks much brighter.

So without further ado, let’s dig into last month’s haul.

## Shida Shahabi – Shifts (LP)

Amidst the rocky parts, February also provided a couple of nice moments. On a visit to Edinburgh’s [Timberyard](https://www.timberyard.co/) (Clair’s birthday present – thanks pals!) we were treated not only to amazing food but also this memorable musical accompaniment; the perfect antidote to the arctic conditions outside. Swedish-Iranian pianist Shida’s melodies are hauntingly beautiful in their own right but interestingly she also overlays sounds from the inner mechanics of the piano. Modern classical isn’t normally my bag, but I love this (and the cover art, too).

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Futo

## Bibio – Ribbons (LP)

Okay, I’m late with this one – it was released in April ‘19 – but who cares. _Ribbons_ has been a Spotify staple of my morning commute for some time; its pastoral vibes setting the perfect laid-back mood before a day writing code. Eventually I liked it so much that I needed a physical copy! The vibe is pretty folky and in places you can imagine being at a live jam session in your favourite traditional pub. Stephen Wilkinson is a fantastic musician with a lovely voice but if all this is sounding too _nice_ then rest assured that, being on Warp Records, it’s served with a generous side-helping of analogue synths and quirky electronics to steer things left of centre.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Curls

## Al Charles – Outstanding

Who knew there was a reggae version of The Gap Band’s early eighties classic, _Outstanding_? Not me, anyway. This has been lovingly reissued by Edinburgh’s Athens of the North and features a great squelchy bassline, shimmering synths and that killer, catchy song. All this plus great dub sensibilities which really shine halfway through. At this point I’ll hand over to Discogs legend [midnightrunner](https://www.discogs.com/user/midnightrunner)’s review which puts it much better than I ever could:

> Quite simply, "outstanding" reggae funk fusion! My mam's toyboy, Gavin, likes to play this one after I have gone to bed, when he smokes his special pipe full of jazzy cabbage.

## Logic1000 – Logic1000

Sydney–born, Melbourne–based producer Samantha Poulter aka Logic1000 is a new name to me. Her sound is a spacey, percussive blend of hip-hop, Bass, Dancehall and House, with all sorts of other interesting samples and influences thrown into the pot. Lots of great stuff on here.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Na feat. DJ Plead

## Perko – The City Rings

I loved Glaswegian Perko’s first release, NV Auto; its blend of dubbed out synth chords juxtaposed with deep sub-bass and hard broken-electro beats really hitting the spot. His latest release, also on [Numbers](http://nmbrs.net/), ploughs a similar furrow. It spans 8 tracks in which he at times ratchets up the BPMs even further into Drum and Bass territory whilst also offering respite in the form of some lovely ambient interludes.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Stutter

## Khruangbin ‎– Hasta El Cielo (LP)

This is the dub remix version of the Texas band’s second LP, _Con Todo El Mondo_. Released in 2019, I don’t know why I didn’t pick it up sooner given that I love Khruangbin and I love dub, except perhaps that records ain’t cheap and I wasn’t sure a remix LP constituted an essential purchase. However, after a few months of blissful headphone listening I realised the error of my ways. The band’s sound lends itself perfectly to this treatment and the addition of two mixes by legendary engineer Scientist seals the deal. Also – check this band live if you ever get the chance. I did [a couple of years back](https://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/live-music/reviews/khruangbin-cca-glasgow-4-feb) and they were amazing.

## Lo Kindre – Chlorophytum

This has been on my wants list for an age but every time I tried to get a copy last year, I couldn’t find one. I’m not sure if the original release was maybe delayed? Fortunately on a recent visit to Rubadub (all too infrequent these days which I mean to rectify) the guys hooked me up. This is on the slow, low and out-there electronic tip with little Kraftwerkian influences in amongst the haze of dub. Apparently it’s also from the south side of Glasgow so if I ever see this dude in the Allison Arms I should jolly well like to buy him a pint. Lovely sleeve art too.
