This Design System reference website sports a smart architecture with some interesting sections.
---

The components are neatly organised into categories. And I like the _Foundations_ area which includes a [Design System Concepts](https://design.gs.com/foundation/design-system-concepts) section serving as a glossary of property and anatomical terms, plus an Accessibility section with neat diagrams.

I think what I like best about this site/system is its organisation and naming.
