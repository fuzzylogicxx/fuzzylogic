Had a great day with Mark and Alan on Saturday climbing [Ben Lomond](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/ben-lomond.shtml). Although I’m not much of a hill-walker I reckon that’s the third [Munro I have bagged](https://www.visitscotland.com/things-to-do/outdoor-activities/walking/mountains-hills/munro-bagging).

We were staying overnight at our friend Jim’s family cabin at Rowardennan and it was a short walk from there to the mountain. The start is steep and the weather progressively worsened until the rain was horizontal, but nonetheless we reached the summit (3200 feet above sea level) in around two hours up then skipped back down in only another hour. We were pretty proud of ourselves to do it in just over three hours!

After that we enjoyed steak pie, fish and chips and victory pints at the Rowardennan hotel. A perfect day. 

Mind you, over the last couple of days I’ve been feeling pain in muscles I didn’t know existed!
