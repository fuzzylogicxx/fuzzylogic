An interview with Ashley 'Dotty' Charles, a writer and broadcaster, on the topic of online outrage.

> By shouting about the little things, are we neglecting to talk about theÂ bigger issues in modern society? We discuss the difference between performative outrage, the role of the social media provocateur and the strange case of Rachel Dolezal.

I really enjoyed this (it totally chimed with how I currently feel about the state of online discourse) and have already bought Dottyâs book, Outraged.

Thanks to Rita (Kelly) for the tip!
