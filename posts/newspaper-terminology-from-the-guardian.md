The web and print are different media, however I still find some of print’s time-honoured terminology useful for naming things.

For example I use _standfirst_ to identify intro paragraphs on [Greenhill Journal Entries](https://www.greenhilldigital.com/journal/greenhill-goes-back-to-school). This Guardian resource is a useful reference.
