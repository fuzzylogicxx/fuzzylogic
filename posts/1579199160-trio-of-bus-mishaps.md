As I got on my usual bus from Stockwell St to Vic Rd this eve, I noticed it was the same driver whose bus Iâ€™d taken twice last week and both times it had broken down â€“ thatâ€™s two days in a row â€“ leaving me to walk home in the usual January post-apocalyptic shitstorm. I got on his bus today and no sooner was it 200 yards down the road than it crashed into a taxi, across from Marks and Sparks. Everybody out â€“ again. Thatâ€™s 3 times Iâ€™ve been on his bus, and three times itâ€™s broken down for one reason or another. The shittest hat-trick ever ðŸ˜‚. I need to find out this guyâ€™s name so I can never get on a plane with him.
