Something Adrian Roselli said recently has stuck with me. The gist was that developers shouldn’t treat MDN as gospel, but rather refer to the proper specifications for web standards.

HTML
[The HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)

ARIA
[W3C’s ARIA in HTML document](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/)
Adrian will quote or reference this when talking about roles, landmarks and the like… for example when [he tweeted about developers using `section`](https://twitter.com/aardrian/status/1587524667325177864).

Miscellaneous
How useful is MDN?
[Adrian re. were MDN references WHATWG HTML:](https://adrianroselli.com/2018/09/hack-on-mdn.html)

> MDN typically references WHATWG HTML, which often gets accessibility… well, not quite right. Part of my efforts included updating the accessibility content to point to the W3C specs wherever appropriate.
