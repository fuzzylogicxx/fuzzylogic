Introducing `dialog`: a new, easier, standards-based means of rendering a popup or modal dialogue.
---

The new element can be styled via CSS and comes with Javascript methods to show and close a dialog. We can also listen for and react to the show and close events.

Although currently only supported in Chrome, the Google Chrome dev team have provided [a polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill) which patches support in all modern browsers and back to IE9.
