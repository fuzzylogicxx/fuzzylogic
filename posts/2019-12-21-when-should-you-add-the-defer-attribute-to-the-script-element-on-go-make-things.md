For many years Iâ€™ve placed my `<script>` in the `<footer>` rather than the `<head>`, so as to:

1. optimise performance by not having something render-blocking at the top of the document; and 
2. remove the need for a parent `DOMContentLoaded` listener by virtue of the `<script>` being positioned after the body of the page.

It turns out that my time-honoured default is OK, but not the best approach.

Chris has done the research for us and ascertained that placing the `<script>` in the `<head>` and adding the `defer` attribute has the same effect as putting that <script> in the footer but offers improved performance. 

This treads fairly complex territory but my general understanding is this:

Using `defer` on a `<script>` in the `<head>` allows the browser to download the script _earlier_, in parallel, so that it is ready to be used as soon as the DOM is ready rather than having to be downloaded and parsed at that point.
