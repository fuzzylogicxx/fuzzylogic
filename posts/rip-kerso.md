On Saturday my friend Mick called to give me the shock news that our mutual friend, Kerso (Graham) had passed away. I’ve known Kerso for around 26 years, since I worked in Bomba records. He was a force of nature, a generous soul, a good guy. I and all his friends loved him. 

Some of my favourite Kerso memories include him bounding into the shops where I worked (either Bomba or later Sound Control) on a Saturday afternoon, big broad smile and dressed immaculately, embodying the feeling that the weekend had landed. Or at club nights and parties or when he was on the decks, always a bundle of energy and a blur of hair! There was the time he bought me a signed copy of Neil Lennon’s biography for my birthday, having queued to get Lenny’s signature despite not being a fan himself (to put it lightly) but because he knew I’d love the gift. Then there’s his 40th birthday do at the Sub Club, a legendary party and where Clair and I met. I could go on, and on.

He was an integral part of many scenes – music, clothes, trainers, football and beyond – and had many, many friends. We’ll all miss him dearly.
