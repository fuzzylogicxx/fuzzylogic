> I think of him as a true bohemian; he made etchings, he wrote, he read a lot. Andrew always had a book on the go, maybe two. I remember he gave me his copy of Hunger by Knut Hamsun when I told him I hadnât read it. There was this other side to him that was deep, curious, well-read. I guess he was a classic autodidact, hungry for knowledge.

Over the last week, the UK music scene has been remembering Andrew Weatherall who sadly died aged only 56.

Bobby Gillespieâs tribute recalls how Weatherall was a fan of Primal Screamâs unfashionable songs before he transformed their fortunes with his production on _Loaded_ and _Screamadelica_ and gives an insight into an outsider with a big heart.
