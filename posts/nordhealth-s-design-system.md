There’s so much to admire in Nord Health’s Design System and specifically its reference website.

I love the way it looks and is organised.

There’s a fantastic, practical [accessibility checklist](https://nordhealth.design/accessibility-checklist/).

They document their [naming conventions](https://nordhealth.design/naming/) and the rationale behind them.

They were a trailblazer in [adopting web components](https://nordhealth.design/web-components/) and I love the docs explaining why.

> We’ve chosen to use Web Components because there is a strong requirement for Nord to be used in many different contexts and with varying technologies — from static HTML pages to server-rendered apps, through to single page applications authored with frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Web Components work great for Nord, because they:
>
> * Are tech-agnostic instead of tech-specific
> * Future proof our system with Web Standards
> * Allow us to use any framework or no framework at all
> * Provide great encapsulation for styles and functionality

Lastly [their components](https://nordhealth.design/components/) look great and show a really high-level of front-end and accessibility literacy.
