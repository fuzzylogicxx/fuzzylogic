A designer colleague recently asked me what course or resources I would recommend for learning front-end web development. She mentioned React at the beginning but I suggested that it’d be better to start by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As for React: it’s a subset or offshoot of JavaScript so it makes sense to understand vanilla JS first.

For future reference, here are my tips.

## Everything in one place

Google’s web.dev training resource have also been adding some excellent guides, such as:

- [Learn HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html/)
- [Learn Accessibility](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/)
- [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/)
- [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design/)

Another great one-stop shop is [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). Not only is MDN an amazing general quick reference for all HTML elements, CSS properties, JavaScript APIs etc but for more immersive learning there are also [MDN’s guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

## Pay attention to HTML

One general piece of advice is that when people look at lists of courses (whether or not they are new to web development) they ensure to learn HTML. People tend to underestimate how complicated, fast-moving and important HTML is.

## Learning CSS, specifically

If you prefer videos, you could check out Steve Griffith’s video series [Learning CSS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe). Steve’s videos are comprehensive and well-paced. It contains a whole range of topics (over 100!), starting from the basics like [CSS Box Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubwqbzQUcg&list=PLyuRouwmQCjl4wTSNbb8RTKZuyMhoIxBe&index=6).

## Learning JavaScript

I recommended choosing a course or courses from CSS-Tricks’ post [Beginner JavaScript notes](https://css-tricks.com/beginner-javascript-notes/), especially as it includes Wes Bos’s [Beginner JavaScript Notes + Reference](https://wesbos.com/javascript).

## Learning Responsive Design

I recommend Jeremy Keith’s [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design/) course on web.dev.

## Lists of courses

You might choose a course or courses from CSS-Tricks’ post [Where do you learn HTML and CSS in 2020?](https://css-tricks.com/where-do-you-learn-html-css-in-2020/)
