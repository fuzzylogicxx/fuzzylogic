A designer colleague recently asked me what course or resources I would recommend for learning front-end web development. She mentioned React at the beginning but I suggested that it’d be better to start by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As for React: it’s a subset or offshoot of JavaScript so it makes sense to understand vanilla JS first.

For future reference, here are my tips.

## Learning HTML & CSS

I recommend choosing a course or courses from CSS-Tricks’ post [Where do you learn HTML and CSS in 2020?](https://css-tricks.com/where-do-you-learn-html-css-in-2020/)

## Learning JavaScript

I recommended choosing a course or courses from CSS-Tricks’ post [Beginner JavaScript notes](https://css-tricks.com/beginner-javascript-notes/), especially as it includes Wes Bos’s [Beginner JavaScript Notes + Reference](https://wesbos.com/javascript).

## Learning Responsive Design

I recommend Jeremy Keith’s [Learn Responsive Design](https://web.dev/learn/design/) course on web.dev.
