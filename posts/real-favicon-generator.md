Knowing how best to serve, size and format favicons and other icons for the many different device types and operating systems can be a minefield. My current best practice approach is to create a 260px Ã— 260px (or larger) source icon then upload it to [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

This is the tool <a href="[https://css-tricks.com/favicon-quiz/](https://css-tricks.com/favicon-quiz/ "https://css-tricks.com/favicon-quiz/")">recommended by CSS-Tricks</a> and it takes care of most of the pain by not only generating all the formats and sizes you need but also providing some code to put in your <code><head></code> and <code>site.webmanifest</code> file.
