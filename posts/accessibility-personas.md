This interesting website from the GDS accessibility team sets out seven personas, each with different access needs. 

> You can use these profiles to experience the web from the perspective of the personas and gain more understanding of accessibility issues.

The site explains how to set up a device or browser to give each persona its own profile simulating the personaâ€™s condition(s) and runs the assistive technology they use to help them.
