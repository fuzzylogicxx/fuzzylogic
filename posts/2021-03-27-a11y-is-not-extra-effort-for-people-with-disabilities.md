Strong agree with these sentiments on accessibility expressed by Max BÃ¶ck and Andrey Okonetchnikov on Twitter.

From Andrey:

> If youâre building UI, itâs your responsibility to make it work for everyone. Clients often tell me âwe donât care about accessibilityâ but in reality they do want keyboard support at the very least. So I just build my UI in a way it works without discussing it. Itâs my job.

Then, in quote tweeting, Max follows up with:

> This. A11y is not "extra effort for people with disabilities", it's just part of a well-crafted UI.

Couldnât agree more.
