Last weekend was pretty dull and rainy in Glasgow but Clair and I visited a bunch of great local places to keep the spirits up.

On Friday night we ate at [Wasabi](https://wasabiglasgow.co.uk/) for the first time. It’s a lovely little spot on Pollokshaws Road with a [nicely-sized menu](https://wasabiglasgow.co.uk/). Between us we had Chicken Karage, Avocado Maki, King Prawn Tempura and Beef Ramen. We loved it and will be back.

On Saturday early afternoon we took Rudy for a walk around Pollokshields including Maxwell Park. We were then able to leave him nicely tired and chillin’, and headed to the [FONDS exhibition at the Tramway](https://www.tramway.org/event/b1e2f38f-38c8-4135-b8ef-b103009c4ee4).

Next was a visit to Pisces although we were runnning a bit early so stopped for a drink at Heraghty’s. Tom and Nessa have been telling me they do a good pint of Guinness so I gave it a try.

At Pisces (which was once the site of the legendary _Greek Golden Kebab_) we both tried the Smash burger and fries, and it was pretty tasty.

We’d hoped to visit the ‘hood’s latest cafe, bar and restaurany [Henry’s](https://www.instagram.com/henrysglasgow/?hl=en) for a nightcap, but on arrival there it was jam-packed so we resolved to come back another time.
