In 2020 it was pretty difficult to holiday abroad for two reasons: firstly, the small matter of a global pandemic; and secondly, the arrival of our Border Terrier puppy, Rudy. So we decided to make the most of our beautiful homeland, Scotland, and go on a road trip. 

We’d head primarily up the west coast, taking in some places we’d visited and enjoyed before and others we hadn’t; we’d have some fun with our furry pal; and we’d eat ourselves into a coma.

## Monday

Following a quick stop to pick up our hire car, we set off for Connel, near Oban.

The weather was decent, and there were early signs that Rudy would be a happy traveller. We needed only one brief stop during the 2 hour drive; at lovely Luss for a short walk to allow Rudy some shits and giggles (mainly shits).

By mid-afternoon, we arrived at our destination, The Oyster Inn, donned our Covid masks and dropped off our stuff. We drove into Oban and had a saunter around, stopping to eat scallops at the harbourside Seafood Hut.

That night we ate dinner in our hotel restaurant: Fish Pie and a beer for me, Scampi and a glass of wine for Clair. Perfectly decent pub fare all round. Holiday started!

## Tuesday

We had breakfast in the hotel and it was a good’un: Clair went for a full Scottish, and I had Eggs Royal (poached eggs, salmon, spinach, hollandaise). The tasty fuel was welcome as there were ominous clouds gathering outside (this was to be the only day of bad weather all trip).

We headed for Ganavan beach by which time it was raining pretty heavily. This gave Rudy a chance to show off his new Hi-Vis jacket, which gave us a good laugh! We played fetch-ball with Rudy on his long leash for a while and he got his first experience of playing in the sea.

After that we headed for local attraction McCaig’s tower, although stopped half-way when we realised we’d need to walk the remainer in the rain, like the amateur outdoor folk we are. Instead we got out in Oban and began looking for lunch while the rain continued unabated but it was slim pickings for pet-friendly places. Fortunately after some cold-fingered Googling we found Markie Dan’s, like an oasis in the desert. Clair ate fish and chips (which was tremendous) while I had chicken and rice soup and a smoked haddock and mozarella fish cake. Big up Markie Dan’s and shout out to the toilet vending machine for unexpected X-rated weirdness.

We got back to the Hotel for a rest, then it was time to head for dinner at the [Pierhouse Hotel](https://www.pierhousehotel.co.uk/about/hotel/whos-who) where our pal Fiona is General Manager and which has been on our must-visit list for ages. Despite our canine companion we managed to find a table (thanks David!) and as it sunk in how refined the place was, secretly began praying that the hairy ninja would be on his best behaviour.

For starters and main we had: 

- smoked salmon on cripy salmon skin; 
- breaded oysters with squid ink mayo;
- a seafood platter; 
- lemon sole; and on the side…
- samphire; and 
- chips (obvs)

For dessert, Clair had the burnt cream, where I had their signature orange chocolate cremeux with buckthorn sorbet. (NB: Despite the other amazing food I’ve still to mention, as I look back I hereby award that dessert the “best dish of the holiday” – it was amazing. 

We retired for a whisky (Balvenie Port cask) in the snug with Fiona. It was great!

## Wednesday

Breakfast: C: veggie full scottish – nice. L: Scrambled and SS.

Heading for Glenmoriston. Following last night’s challenges, stopped in at the Pet Shop in Oban to hopefully pick up some superior chews to keep Rudy occupied.

Enter _Dynoroad_:  a stick of Himilayan Yak Milk that would bring us peace at meal times we would never have dreamed possible.

The most amazing drive in the sunshine from Oban to Kentallen (stopping at Holly House Hotel for a great burger / breaded brie) through Ballachulish to Fort William. 

Scenery incredible (especially at the point just before and after Ballachulish); Scotland at its bonniest.

We climbed over 1200 feet through the hills and settled at The Cluanie Inn. 

Stunning location. Literally right in the middle of the hills. Deer roaming free. 

Rudy going a bit stir-crazy with the space he had available and ruining our picturesque “beer in the hills” vision by eating deer-jobbies.

Lovely dinner: LH had South Indian Garlic Chicken. Clair had roast pork stir fry. Shared a Rhubarb and Apple Crumble with ice cream.

Retired for a Whisky and a game of Game-On. 

Totally recommend this place.

## Thursday

Breakfast really good. Clair bowl of coco pops then full Scottish. L had yogurt and muesli and scrambled eggs .

We were headed for Ullapool (Clair was very excited to be reunited with the Seafood Shack and its owners having taken photos for their forthcoming book earlier in the year).

Another beautiful drive. Invernesss Road. 

Musically we went for Clair’s “alternative 80s” playlist (Television, Echo and The Bunnymen, Cocteau Twins) followed by Andy M’s “Go mild in the country”.

2 x lunch at the Seafood Shack. Haddock Wraps. Cullen Skink. Langoustine in Butter.

Walk up Ullapool Hill.

Checked into Celidh Place. Warm welcome.

Beer outside.

Dinner. L: Venison Stew. C: Fish and Chips. For dessert we shared baked cheesecake with berries. Rudy ate Dynorod. 

C had Harris gin.

Talked about our all-time favourite long tracks. C said Riders on the Storm. L said Papa was a Rolling Stone.

## Friday

Breakfast: porridge with prunes: a wee bit salty. C had a full Scottish. Breakfast not the highlight but otherwise we loved this place.

Had a lie-in.

Wander around Ullapool.

Final lunch at seafood shack: C got spineys; L had mackeral paté with oatcakes. Delicious!

Set off for Craigenallechie.

Passed Forres Mechanics football ground.

Sean Keveney the perfect travelling companion, especially Uncle Frank’s Friday Floor Fillers (Papa was a Rolling Stone).

This place is great.

Dinner: Starters: L had haggis bon-bons; Clair had scallops with cauliflower pureé. C fish special which was Cod with sweetcorn and crab. Side of mac and cheese. LH Ribeye steak. 

L drank a Spey Valley 1814 then a Windwept APA. Both lovely. C had Edinburgh gin.

Zero room for dessert.

Staff were lovely inc Director Kevin who found us a table at the Quaich. Retired there for a whisky. LH Aberlour 12 yo. Clair had a Glenrothes.

## Saturday

Headed home. LH picked up whisky at the Aberlour distillery shop.
