In 2020 it's been pretty difficult to holiday abroad for two reasons: firstly, the small matter of a global pandemic; and secondly, the arrival of our Border Terrier puppy, Rudy. So we decided to make the most of our beautiful homeland, Scotland, and go on a road trip. 

The plan was straightforward: we’d head primarily up the west coast, taking in new places and familiar favourites; we’d enjoy some “first holiday” fun with our furry pal; and over five nights we’d eat ourselves into a seafood-induced coma.

In reality the organising of this holiday was a bit trickier than it might otherwise have been, in that it was our first experience of searching for pet-friendly accommodation, which was compounded by many venues running at lower capacity due to covid considerations. But thanks to some great recommendations from friends, we found a handful of suitable spots.

Here’s the lowdown on our trip, including everywhere we ate and stayed in case it sparks any inspiration for you, too.

## Monday

Following a quick stop to collect our hire car, we set off for Connel, near Oban.

The weather was decent, and there were early signs that Rudy would be a happy traveller. In fact we needed only one brief stop during the two and a half hour drive; at lovely Luss for a breath of fresh air and some shits and giggles (mainly shits).

By mid-afternoon we had arrived at our destination, [The Oyster Inn](http://www.oysterinn.co.uk/), taken a moment to admire the view over Loch Etive, then donned our Covid masks to check-in and ditch our bags. 

We made the 10 minute drive into Oban then enjoyed a saunter around the shops overlooking the bay, stopping to eat scallops at the harbourside [Green Shack Seafood Hut](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186501-d2091037-Reviews-Oban_Seafood_Hut-Oban_Argyll_and_Bute_Scotland.html). Aside from Rudy trying to eat _everything_ on the ground around us, this was magic.

Later that night we ate dinner in our hotel bar-restaurant: Fish Pie and a beer for me, Scampi and a glass of wine for Clair. Perfectly decent pub fare all round. Holiday underway!

## Tuesday

We started the day with breakfast in the hotel and it was a good’un: Clair plumped for a “full Scottish”, and I had Eggs Royal (poached eggs, salmon, spinach, hollandaise sauce). With black clouds gathering ominously outside (it was the only day of bad weather during the entire trip), this tasty fuel was exactly what was required.

We headed for Ganavan beach and by the time we arrived it was raining pretty heavily. This gave Rudy a chance to strut his stuff in a new Hi-Vis, waterproof jacket. We played fetch-ball for a while and he had his first experience of paddling in the sea.

After that we drove toward local attraction McCaig’s tower, although when it became apparent we’d need to get out and walk the second half in the rain we axed the idea, like the amateur outdoor adventurers we are. Instead we parked up in Oban and began looking for lunch while the rain continued unabated. It was slim pickings for pet-friendly venues and we suffered a couple of knock-backs. Fortunately, after some frozen-fingered Googling, we found Markie Dan’s – a pooch-friendly oasis in the desert. Clair ate fish and chips (which was tremendous) while I had chicken and rice soup and a smoked haddock and mozarella fish cake. Big up Markie Dan’s and shout out to their toilet vending machine for unexpected X-rated weirdness.

Sidenote: this wee lunchtime challenge and the relief of finally finding somewhere prompted me to consider restarting work on a side-project I’d previously put on ice. The idea is an online directory of quality family and pet-friendly bars, restaurants, and perhaps also hotels given the challenges we had booking accommodation, and it would list which of these are near your current location. Maybe someday I’ll get around to it.

With happy bellies we retired to the Hotel for a rest, before it was time to head for dinner at the [Pierhouse Hotel](https://www.pierhousehotel.co.uk/about/hotel/whos-who). Our pal Fiona is General Manager there and it had been on our visit-list for ages. 

Despite having a canine companion we were graciously accommodated (thanks David!), although as it dawned on us how refined our surroundings were, we secretly began praying that the hairy ninja would be on his best behaviour.

The Pierhouse lived up to its reputation. 

For starters and mains we had:

- smoked salmon on cripy salmon skin; 
- breaded oysters with squid ink mayo;
- a seafood platter; 
- lemon sole; and on the side…
- samphire; and 
- chips (obvs)

For dessert, Clair had the burnt cream, while I had their signature orange chocolate cremeux with buckthorn sorbet. (NB: Despite the cast of other amazing dishes I’ve still to mention, as I look back on the overall trip I’m moved to award this dessert “Dish of the Holiday” – it really was off-the-scale!)

As we finished our meal, Fiona arrived to greet us and ushered us into “The Snug” for a whisky to cap the night. (Balvenie Port cask, since you ask, and it fairly warmed the cockles.) It was lovely to catch up and a brilliant night overall.

## Wednesday

We had time for one more breakfast at The Oyster Inn before leaving, and once again it hit the target. Clair went for the veggie scottish breakfast, and I for scrambled eggs and smoked salmon.

Our next stop was Glenmoriston, but before leaving Oban we had important matters to attend to. Following last night’s challenges with Rudy we stopped in at the Pet Shop in Oban to hopefully pick up some superior chews to keep Rudy occupied.

Enter _Dynoroad_ (not real name):  a stick of “Himilayan Yak Milk” (yes, really) that would bring us a meal-time peace we had hitherto thought impossible.

The most amazing drive in the sunshine from Oban to Kentallen (stopping at Holly House Hotel for a great burger / breaded brie) through Ballachulish to Fort William. 

Scenery incredible (especially at the point just before and after Ballachulish); Scotland at its bonniest.

We climbed over 1200 feet through the hills and settled at The Cluanie Inn. 

Stunning location. Literally right in the middle of the hills. Deer roaming free. 

Rudy going a bit stir-crazy with the space he had available and shattering our picturesque “beer in the hills” vision by eating deer-jobbies.

Lovely dinner: LH had South Indian Garlic Chicken. Clair had roast pork stir fry. Shared a Rhubarb and Apple Crumble with ice cream.

Retired for a Whisky and a game of Game-On. 

Totally recommend this place.

## Thursday

Breakfast really good. Clair bowl of coco pops then full Scottish. L had yogurt and muesli and scrambled eggs .

We were headed for Ullapool (Clair was very excited to be reunited with the Seafood Shack and its owners having taken photos for their forthcoming book earlier in the year).

Another beautiful drive. Invernesss Road. 

Musically we went for Clair’s “alternative 80s” playlist (Television, Echo and The Bunnymen, Cocteau Twins) followed by Andy M’s “Go mild in the country”.

2 x lunch at the Seafood Shack. Haddock Wraps. Cullen Skink. Langoustine in Butter.

Walk up Ullapool Hill.

Checked into Celidh Place. Warm welcome.

Beer outside.

Dinner. L: Venison Stew. C: Fish and Chips. For dessert we shared baked cheesecake with berries. Rudy ate Dynorod. 

C had Harris gin.

Talked about our all-time favourite long tracks. C said Riders on the Storm. L said Papa was a Rolling Stone.

## Friday

Breakfast: porridge with prunes: a wee bit salty. C had a full Scottish. Breakfast not the highlight but otherwise we loved this place.

Had a lie-in.

Wander around Ullapool.

Final lunch at seafood shack: C got spineys; L had mackeral paté with oatcakes. Delicious!

Set off for Craigenallechie.

Passed Forres Mechanics football ground.

Sean Keveney the perfect travelling companion, especially Uncle Frank’s Friday Floor Fillers (Papa was a Rolling Stone).

This place is great.

Dinner: Starters: L had haggis bon-bons; Clair had scallops with cauliflower pureé. C fish special which was Cod with sweetcorn and crab. Side of mac and cheese. LH Ribeye steak. 

L drank a Spey Valley 1814 then a Windwept APA. Both lovely. C had Edinburgh gin.

Zero room for dessert.

Staff were lovely inc Director Kevin who found us a table at the Quaich. Retired there for a whisky. LH Aberlour 12 yo. Clair had a Glenrothes.

## Saturday

Headed home. LH picked up whisky at the Aberlour distillery shop.
