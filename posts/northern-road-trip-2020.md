In 2020 it's been pretty difficult to holiday abroad for two reasons: firstly, the small matter of a global pandemic; and secondly, the arrival of our Border Terrier puppy, Rudy. So we decided to make the most of our beautiful homeland, Scotland, and go on a road trip. 

The plan was straightforward: we’d head primarily up the west coast, taking in new places and familiar favourites; we’d enjoy some “first holiday” fun with our furry pal; and over five nights we’d eat ourselves into a seafood-induced coma.

In reality the organising of this holiday was a bit trickier than it might otherwise have been, in that it was our first experience of searching for pet-friendly accommodation, which was compounded by many venues running at lower capacity due to covid considerations. But thanks to some great recommendations from friends, we found a handful of suitable spots.

Here’s the lowdown on our trip, including everywhere we ate and stayed in case it sparks any inspiration for you, too.

## Monday

Following a quick stop to collect our hire car, we set off for Connel, near Oban.

The weather was decent, and there were early signs that Rudy would be a happy traveller. In fact we needed only one brief stop during the two and a half hour drive; at lovely Luss for a breath of fresh air and some shits and giggles (mainly shits).

By mid-afternoon we had arrived at our destination, [The Oyster Inn](http://www.oysterinn.co.uk/), taken a moment to admire the view over Loch Etive, then donned our Covid masks to check-in and ditch our bags. 

We made the 10 minute drive into Oban then enjoyed a saunter around the shops overlooking the bay, stopping to eat scallops at the harbourside [Green Shack Seafood Hut](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186501-d2091037-Reviews-Oban_Seafood_Hut-Oban_Argyll_and_Bute_Scotland.html). Aside from Rudy trying to eat _everything_ on the ground around us, this was magic.

Later that night we ate dinner in The [Glue Pot](http://www.oysterinn.co.uk/glue-pot.html), our hotel bar-restaurant – Fish Pie and a beer for me, Scampi and a glass of wine for Clair. Good pub fare all round. The holiday was off to a fine start!

## Tuesday

We started the day with breakfast in the hotel and it was a good’un: Clair opted t for a “full Scottish”, and I had Eggs Royal (poached eggs, salmon, spinach, hollandaise sauce). With black clouds gathering ominously outside (it was the only day of bad weather during the entire trip), this tasty fuel was exactly what was required.

We headed for [Ganavan Sands](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/towns-villages/ganavan-sands-p315601) and by the time we arrived it was raining pretty heavily. However every cloud has a silver lining and this gave Rudy a chance to strut his stuff in his new Hi-Vis, waterproof jacket. We played fetch for a wee while and he had his first experience of paddling in the sea.

We left for local historic attraction [McCaig’s Tower](https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/mccaigs-tower-p255141), although when it became apparent that the final climb is on foot and we’d need to get back out in the rain we axed the idea, like the amateur adventurers we are. Instead we parked up in Oban and began hunting for lunch, while the rain continued unabated. Frustratingly it was slim pickings for pet-friendly venues and we endured a couple of knock-backs. Finally, after some frozen-fingered Googling, we found [Markie Dan’s](https://markiedans.co.uk/), like a pooch-friendly oasis in the desert. Clair ate fish and chips (which was dynamite) while I had chicken and rice soup and a smoked haddock and mozarella fish cake, washed down with a tasty pint of something local. Big up Markie Dan’s! (And shout out to their toilet vending machine for unexpected X-rated weirdness.)

Sidenote: this wee lunchtime challenge prompted me to consider restarting a side-project I’d previously put on ice. The idea is an online directory of quality child and pet-friendly bars, restaurants, accommodation which – if you give it your current location – would list the nearest places to you. That would’ve been handy that day. Maybe someday I’ll get around to it.

With happy bellies we retired to the Hotel for a rest, before it was time to head to Port Appin for dinner at the [Pierhouse Hotel](https://www.pierhousehotel.co.uk/about/hotel/whos-who). Our pal [Fiona](https://twitter.com/missfionamclean) is General Manager there and it had been on our visit-list for ages. 

Despite bringing a canine companion we were graciously accommodated (thanks David!), although as it dawned on us how refined our surroundings were, we secretly began praying that the tiny terrier would be on his best behaviour.

The Pierhouse is beautifully located and the restaurant certainly lived up to its reputation.

For starters and mains we had:

- smoked salmon on cripy salmon skin; 
- breaded oysters with squid ink mayo;
- a seafood platter; 
- lemon sole; and on the side…
- samphire; and 
- chips (obvs)

For dessert, Clair had the burnt cream, while I had their signature orange chocolate cremeux with buckthorn sorbet. (NB: Despite the cast of other amazing dishes I’ve still to mention, as I look back on the overall trip I’m moved to award this dessert “Dish of the Holiday” – it really was off-the-scale!)

While dining, Rudy (stashed away under our table) was a bit of handful. In COVID-times, Scottish venues have no background music and are sparser than usual, so we were on high alert to catch any unacceptable doggy behaviours before they happened and marked us out as “the pain in the ass couple with the dog”. Fortunately aside from a bit of potted plant nibbling and numerous escape attempts he didn’t do anything too visibly embarassing, although keeping one hand on him while trying to eat a plate of seafood was a bit like The Krypton Factor.

As we finished our meal, Fiona arrived to greet us and ushered us into “The Snug” for a whisky to cap the night. (Balvenie Port cask, since you ask, and it fairly warmed the cockles.) It was lovely to catch up and a brilliant night overall.

## Wednesday

We had time for one more breakfast at The Oyster Inn before leaving, and once again it hit the target. Clair went for the veggie scottish breakfast, while I had scrambled eggs and smoked salmon.

Our next stop was Glenmoriston, but before leaving Oban we had important matters to address. Following last night’s challenges with Rudy we resolved to find some superior chew-chews to keep him occupied during the remaining meal-times, so stopped in at a wee Pet Shop we‘d noticed in Oban the previous day.

Enter _Dynorod_ (not real name) – a stick of “Himilayan Yak Milk” (yes, really) that would usher in zen-like peace at mealtimes we had hitherto thought impossible.

Tooled up and ready, we embarked on the most amazing sunshine drive from Oban to Kentallen (stopping at the [Holly Tree Hotel](https://hollytreehotel.co.uk/) for a great burger and walk along the pier) through Ballachulish to Fort William. We’d travelled this route many times before, but this time the scenery looked even more incredible (especially at the point just around Ballachulish). It was Scotland at its bonniest.

We then climbed over 1200 feet through the hills before settling at our destination, [The Cluanie Inn](https://www.blacksheephotels.com/cluanie-inn-home/). I can’t over-emphasise this: this location is stunning. You are literally right in the middle of the hills, with deer roaming freely around you.

The sun was still out and 

Rudy going a bit stir-crazy with the space he had available and shattering our picturesque “beer in the hills” vision by eating deer-jobbies.

Lovely dinner: LH had South Indian Garlic Chicken. Clair had roast pork stir fry. Shared a Rhubarb and Apple Crumble with ice cream.

Retired for a Whisky and a game of Game-On. 

Totally recommend this place.

## Thursday

Breakfast really good. Clair bowl of coco pops then full Scottish. L had yogurt and muesli and scrambled eggs .

We were headed for Ullapool (Clair was very excited to be reunited with the Seafood Shack and its owners having taken photos for their forthcoming book earlier in the year).

Another beautiful drive. Invernesss Road. 

Musically we went for Clair’s “alternative 80s” playlist (Television, Echo and The Bunnymen, Cocteau Twins) followed by Andy M’s “Go mild in the country”.

2 x lunch at the Seafood Shack. Haddock Wraps. Cullen Skink. Langoustine in Butter.

Walk up Ullapool Hill.

Checked into Celidh Place. Warm welcome.

Beer outside.

Dinner. L: Venison Stew. C: Fish and Chips. For dessert we shared baked cheesecake with berries. Rudy ate Dynorod. 

C had Harris gin.

Talked about our all-time favourite long tracks. C said Riders on the Storm. L said Papa was a Rolling Stone.

## Friday

Breakfast: porridge with prunes: a wee bit salty. C had a full Scottish. Breakfast not the highlight but otherwise we loved this place.

Had a lie-in.

Wander around Ullapool.

Final lunch at seafood shack: C got spineys; L had mackeral paté with oatcakes. Delicious!

Set off for Craigenallechie.

Passed Forres Mechanics football ground.

Sean Keveney the perfect travelling companion, especially Uncle Frank’s Friday Floor Fillers (Papa was a Rolling Stone).

This place is great.

Dinner: Starters: L had haggis bon-bons; Clair had scallops with cauliflower pureé. C fish special which was Cod with sweetcorn and crab. Side of mac and cheese. LH Ribeye steak. 

L drank a Spey Valley 1814 then a Windwept APA. Both lovely. C had Edinburgh gin.

Zero room for dessert.

Staff were lovely inc Director Kevin who found us a table at the Quaich. Retired there for a whisky. LH Aberlour 12 yo. Clair had a Glenrothes.

## Saturday

Headed home. LH picked up whisky at the Aberlour distillery shop.
