I really like Jim’s idea of putting an avatar file somewhere that’s memorable and easy to access by me wherever I am and that also (in the future) might be automatically grabbable by any platform that needs my avatar.

So I’ve put my avatar at [fuzzylogic.me/.well-known/avatar](https://fuzzylogic.me/.well-known/avatar).

Great idea, Jim!
