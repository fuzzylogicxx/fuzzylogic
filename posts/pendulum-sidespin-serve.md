Great video (in German with subtitles) which shows and tells the most important elements of this serve, namely:

1. Brush the ball sideways extremely fast; 
2. Swing your wrist about 90Â° extremely fast when touching the ball; and
3. The third bounce should be close to the side-edge of the table so that the opponent cannot easily attack and your spin has the strongest effect.
