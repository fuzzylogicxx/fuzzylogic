Over the years I’ve seen Herr Henke (of [Monolake](https://www.discogs.com/artist/534-Monolake) fame) doing variously-themed live shows and in a variety of locations. I loved [this particular show](https://roberthenke.com/concerts/cbm8032av.html) and it was made even better by catching him at [The Tramway Theatre](https://www.tramway.org/about-tramway/), one of my favourite venues and just 10 minutes walk from home.

Here’s a little [about CBM 8032 AV](https://roberthenke.com/concerts/cbm8032av.html) in the great man’s own words:

> CBM 8032 AV is an exploration of the beauty of simple graphics and sound, using computers from the early 1980’s. Everything presented within the project could have been done already in the 1980, but it needed the cultural backdrop of today to come up with the artistic ideas driving it. On stage are five carefully restored Commodore CBM 8032 computers, running custom software developed by the artist and his team. Three computers create sound, one machine is responsible for the graphics and one is controlling all the others, with their green cathode ray tube displays facing the audience, operated by the artist during the show.

I was there with Tom and Simon. Here’s a little phone recording captured by Tom.

We left thinking that Robert really is a genius. I’ve always loved his music and he is still doing fresh, inventive and wonderful things.
