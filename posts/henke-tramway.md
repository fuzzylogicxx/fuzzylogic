> CBM 8032 AV is an exploration of the beauty of simple graphics and sound, using computers from the early 1980’s. Everything presented within the project could have been done already in the 1980, but it needed the cultural backdrop of today to come up with the artistic ideas driving it. On stage are five carefully restored Commodore CBM 8032 computers, running custom software developed by the artist and his team. Three computers create sound, one machine is responsible for the graphics and one is controlling all the others, with their green cathode ray tube displays facing the audience, operated by the artist during the show.
