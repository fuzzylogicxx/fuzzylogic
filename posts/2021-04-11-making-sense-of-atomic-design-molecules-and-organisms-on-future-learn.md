From 2015: Alla Kholmatova reflects on the difficulty in choosing between _molecule_ or _organism_ when categorising components using atomic design at FutureLearn. She also provides some handy insights into how they handled it.

> When thinking about complexity of elements, it helps viewing molecules as âhelpersâ and organisms as âstandaloneâ modules.

Whereas _helpers_ canât really exist on their own, _standalone_ modules can.

Alla also recommends than in cases where an element doesnât clearly fall into either group, asking the following questions may help:

- Is this _more_ of a supporting element or a standalone one?
- Would it normally be part of something else and be reused within various components? (if so itâs probably a molecule)
- Is it a well defined and relatively independent part or section of a page? (if so probably an organism) (via [@jamesmockett](https://twitter.com/jamesmockett))
