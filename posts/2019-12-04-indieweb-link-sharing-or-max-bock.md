> A pain point of the IndieWeb is that it's sometimes not as convenient to share content as it is on the common social media platforms… That’s why I wanted to improve this process for my site.

This was a fantastic walkthrough by Max. And using this, I’ve just finished implementing my own tweaked version. I think of the saved resources as Bookmarks rather than "shared links", and I’ve used [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) rather than [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for my  bookmark-saving form, but otherwise this is very much based on this superb tutorial. 

In fact, I’ve just bookmarked this page using my shiny new system. Many thanks, [Max](https://twitter.com/mxbck)!
