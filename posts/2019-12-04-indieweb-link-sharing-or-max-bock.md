> A pain point of the IndieWeb is that it's sometimes not as convenient to share content as it is on the common social media platforms… That’s why I wanted to improve this process for my site.

This was a fantastic walkthrough by Max. And based on this, I’ve just finished implementing my own, slightly tweaked, version. 

I already had a _Bookmarks_ section so I’m adding new posts into that. For the bookmark-saving form, I’ve used [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) rather than [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). But otherwise this is very much based on Max’s superb tutorial.

This also provided a great way to dip my toes into using the world of Netlify Functions and their supporting tools, [netlify-dev](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) and [netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda)

There’s more to be done but I wanted the first bookmark created with my shiny new system to be Max’s original tutorial – and this is it. 

Many thanks, [Max]!(https://twitter.com/mxbck)!
