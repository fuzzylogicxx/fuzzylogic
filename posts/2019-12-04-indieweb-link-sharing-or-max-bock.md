> A pain point of the IndieWeb is that it's sometimes not as convenient to share content as it is on the common social media platforms... Thatâs why I wanted to improve this process for my site.

This was a fantastic walkthrough by Max. And using this, Iâve just finished implementing my own tweaked version. I think of them as Bookmarks rather than "shared links", and Iâve used [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) rather than Preact for my  bookmark-saving form, but otherwise this is very much based on this superb tutorial. And in fact, Iâve just bookmarked this page using my shiny new Bookmarker system. Thanks, [Max](https://twitter.com/mxbck)!
