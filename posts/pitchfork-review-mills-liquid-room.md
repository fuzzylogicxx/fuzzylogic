Pitchfork’s review of Jeff Mills’ seminal mixtape is the best-written and most enjoyable music article I’ve read in years. The mixtape in question is also very close to my heart.

Agreed! Fun fact: in 1996, having played the shit out of my cassette copy for a few months, I went to see Jeff DJ at the Arena in Glasgow in 1996 and he signed the inlay! I would normally be embarassed at having done this… but not in this case.
