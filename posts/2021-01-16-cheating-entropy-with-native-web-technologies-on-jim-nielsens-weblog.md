> This is why, over years of building for the web, I have learned that I can significantly cut down on the entropy my future self will have to face by authoring web projects in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. I like to ask myself questions like: 

- Could this be done with native ES modules instead of using a bundler?
- Could I do this with DOM scripting instead of using a JS framework?
- Could I author this in CSS instead of choosing a preprocessor?

Fantastic post from Jim Neilson about how your future self will thank you and be more productive if you keep your stack simple now. (via [@adactio](https://twitter.com/adactio))
