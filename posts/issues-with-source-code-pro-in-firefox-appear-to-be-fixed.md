Last time I tried [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) as my monospaced typeface for code examples in blog posts, it didn’t work out. When viewed in Firefox it would only render in black meaning that I couldn’t display it in white on black for blocks of code. This lead to me having to use something simpler, which I’ve never been happy with.

It now looks like I can try Source Code Pro again because [the issue has been resolved](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/issues/250#issuecomment-728646917). This is great news!

So, I should grab [the latest release](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/latest) and give it another go.

I’d also mentioned the other day that I was planning to [give Source Serif another bash](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/2021-01-31-source-serif-4/) so if everything works out, with these two allied to my existing Source Sans Pro I could have a nice complimentary set.
