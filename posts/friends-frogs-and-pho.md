Today I made good use of a Friday off work. After spending the morning attending to a few bits and bobs while listening to [some lovely music](https://www.discogs.com/release/30625879-Alina-Bzhezhinska-Tony-Kofi-Altera-Vita) I then met Gillian for lunch at a mutual favourite [The Old Fruit Shop](https://www.theoldfruitshop.co.uk/). We had a great chat then enjoyed a stoat around nearby Linn Park. It was sunny enough that were folks swimming beside the waterfall. We had to watch our step to avoid a swarm of teeny-tiny baby frogs (thanks to the lady who pointed them out!).

Later that night Clair and I visited [Pho in Glasgow](https://www.phocafe.co.uk/locations/glasgow/) which was pretty good! To start we shared summer rolls and a Vietnamese chicken and prawn pancake – both delicious – then I had king prawn pho which was also lovely. They had a nice line in non-alcoholic drinks too. Clair had a nojito and I had an alcohol-free negroni, then we followed up with coconut and pineapple water.

We ended the day back at home with Rudy watching the opening ceremony of the Paris olympics while eating an empire biscuit.

A good Friday.
