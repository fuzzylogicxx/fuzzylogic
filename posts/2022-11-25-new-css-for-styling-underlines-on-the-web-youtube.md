We have new properties in CSS for styling underlines, as explained here by Jen Simmons.
---

The relevant properties are:

- `text-decoration-thickness`
- `text-decoration-color`
- `text-underline-offset`
- `text-decoration-skip-ink`

The skip-ink concept becomes more interesting (to me at least) when you're using the other properties (especially  offset) to start the underline higher up the word so it appears _behind_ it.

[Support for these properties looks healthy.](https://caniuse.com/?search=text-underline-offset)
