Had a great catch-up with my friend Doug last night. We went for dinner at [Gaga](https://www.gagaglasgow.com/) in the west end, where co-owner Mark (who we know well from years gone by) gave us a warm welcome and a complimentary cocktail on our arrival – cheers Mark! Food-wise, small plates were the order of the day so we tried fried chicken, prawn toast, sweetcorn fritters, lamb curry and more. Gaga has a great atmosphere and we thoroughly enjoyed it. 

From there it was onto a nearby pub we both know and love, The Thornwood Bar. There, another well-kent face, Scott, served us and also passed on his latest obscure techno tips (always welcome). 

Over a few hours we had the chance to talk family, music and life and I’m feeling all the better for it.
