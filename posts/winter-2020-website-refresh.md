Winter 2020 website refresh, Part 1
---

Started by branching off and cleaning out, except `.git`. 

Added [11ty-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). I started from this in the previous branch too, but wanted to get up to date with the latest version of 11ty, examples of the latest 11ty goodness e.g. changes to navigation etc.

Checked my lighthouse score.
