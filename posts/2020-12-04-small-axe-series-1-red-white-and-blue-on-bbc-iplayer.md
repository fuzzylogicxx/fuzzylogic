One of several fantastic films from Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen (_12 Years a Slave_) described as “Love letters to black resilience and triumph in London's West Indian community. Vivid stories of hard-won victories in the face of racism.”

This one tells the story of Leroy Logan, a young black man who joins the police in an attempt to effect change “from the inside” as a consequence of seeing his father assaulted by police officers. He is faced with both his father’s disapproval and institutional racism within the police ranks.

A  brilliant and powerful film which left its mark on me.

The others in the series – especially [Education](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000qfb1/small-axe-series-1-education), [Lovers Rock](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000prjp/small-axe-series-1-lovers-rock) (don’t miss if you love reggae) and [Mangrove](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p08vy19b/small-axe-series-1-mangrove) are also highly recommended. Wonderful soundtracks, too.
