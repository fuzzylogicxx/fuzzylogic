For a while now I’ve been enjoying this series of bite-sized travel guides from The Guardian, which puts the spotlight on a European town or city and hands over to a switched-on local to share food, shopping, cultural and green space highlights.

Some are more suited to my tastes and budget than others, but overall they’ve been good. And not just for far-flung places – on a recent day-trip east I checked out a number of the stops on [their Edinburgh guide](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/19/locals-guide-to-edinburgh-bookshops-restaurants-parks-cocktail-bars) and it gave me a great basis for further exploration.
