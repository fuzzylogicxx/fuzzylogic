A fantastic so-called “Scroll Story” from Robin Rendle. In his own words it’s “an elaborate blog post where I rant about a thing” however given the beautiful typography, layout and illustrations on show I think he’s selling it a little short!

The content of this “story” is pretty interesting – Robin laments the fact that web authors often need newsletters, or to “spam social media” in order to publicise articles on their websites, because awareness of RSS is too low and barriers to entry too great.

However it’s the story’s design and technical implementation which really caught my eye. 

Robin does some really cool stuff with the CSS `scroll-snap-type` property and also explains some steps he had to take to tame differing implementations of `height:100vh` across browsers.
