A fantastic so-called âScroll Storyâ from Robin Rendle. In his own words itâs âan elaborate blog post where I rant about a thingâ however given the beautiful typography, layout and illustrations on show I think heâs selling it a little short.

The content of this âstoryâ is pretty interesting â Robin laments the fact that web authors often need newsletters or to âspam social mediaâ in order to publicise articles on their websites, because awareness of RSS is too low and barriers to entry to great.

However itâs the design and technical implementation which really caught my eye. Robin does some pretty cool stuff with the CSS `scroll-snap-type` property and also explains some steps he had to take to tame differing implementations  of `height: 100vh` across browsers.
