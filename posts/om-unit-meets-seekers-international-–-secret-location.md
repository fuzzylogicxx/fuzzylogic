Was excited to hear about this collab, and it doesn’t disappoint. 7 tracks of deep, digi-dub bass, hazy textures and dancehall samples and it sounds amazing. Favourite track: Krnch. <https://bit.ly/33g6xOE> <div class="aspect-ratio-wide"><iframe title="Om Unit meets Seekers International – Krnch" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Ys-dGm5Bu4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
