Here’s an interesting tool for creating and sharing small-ish web pages without having to build a website or organise hosting.

> itty.bitty takes html (or other data), compresses it into a URL fragment, and provides a link that can be shared. When it is opened, it inflates that data on the receiver’s side.

While I find this idea interesting, I’m not yet 100% sure how or when I’ll use it! I’m sure it’ll come in handy at some point, though.

Here’s [my first “itty bitty” page](https://itty.bitty.site/#Laurence%E2%80%99s_Itty_Bitty_Test/?XQAAAALHAAAAAAAAAAAkGUpGZJK92rlB0uq9M5C9YTm8ebEX20zjXEyx64k6L8RNUeBvngn2kefaONOBLdlTPDzR98OUYoLzEh6XZKaOsHwrbTV04wugMNaLfhuP9wLEHusrHdgaop7+ChZgRm/q+9hCau/yoH//nAuAAA==), just for fun.
