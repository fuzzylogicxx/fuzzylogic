Had a memorable experience with Jason and Tom last night catching Herbie Hancock at the playhouse. At 82 years old Herbie still has amazing energy and capped his performance with a tour of the stage playing his keytar followed by a scissor jump!

Herbie’s piano playing was mesmerising – the solos really took me to another place and if this is what he plays like in his eighties I can only imagine how good his gigs were in his prime. I also loved his warm anecdotes, including one about his friend Wayne Shorter just before treating us to a rendition of [Footprints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XvJFW0DHbU).

Other highlights included [Cantaloupe Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B1oIXGX0Io), the mindbending [Actual Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP4CJfSN27E) and hearing guitarist Lionel Louke coax sounds from a guitar that you wouldn’t think possible.
