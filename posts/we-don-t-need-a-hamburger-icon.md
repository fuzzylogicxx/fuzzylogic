Smashing Magazine have recently been making the point that “hamburger menus” are proven to be problematic and violate Luke Wroblewski’s _Obvious Always Wins_ mantra.

It includes this assertion:

> But not in a single usability session did they help users navigate faster than a boring, dull yet remarkably efficient **“Menu” button**.

That’s interesting, but there’s no citation and I don’t like that. However they could have listed:

[https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945 "https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945")

[https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/ "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/hamburger-menus/")

In a follow-up they suggest that we should [never hide critical navigation on mobile](https://mailchi.mp/smashingmagazine.com/never-hide-critical-navigation-on-mobile). This post usefully offers a few alternative navigation patterns.
