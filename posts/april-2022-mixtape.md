I put together a fairly spacey and mellow selection of laidback electronic sounds. To me, it has a little nod to summer.

[Download my April 2022 mixtape.](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1oFjh8wpmYm22iPq1Np0pFMFW1XgBKsHX&export=download)

Here’s the tracklist:

* Nale Sinephro - Space 1
* Culross Close - To Belong
* Other Lands - Matter (Reshaped)
* …

This was a nice opportunity to get back into the rhythm of programming music of varying styles and tempos. Kit-wise, I used two Technics 1210s, a Pioneer CDJ-700, an Isonoe 420 mixer and an Eventide Timefactor delay.
