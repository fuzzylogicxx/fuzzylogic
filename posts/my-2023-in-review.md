How was 2023 for you? For me, it was like this.

## Music

### Gigs

In contrast to the Covid years I enjoyed a variety of in-person events. I went to seven gigs: 

- Apiento in London,
- Melting Pot at Queen’s Park Rec (where I saw Luke Una and Odyssey),
- Melting Pot vs Let’s Go Way Back at BAAD,
- Om Unit at Sleazy’s,
- [Robert Henke at Tramway](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/henke-tramway/),
- A Certain Ratio at Stereo in November and
- Sleaford Mods in December.

Of those, my highlights were Robert Henke and A Certain Ratio.

## Listening / buying 

I’m still buying music on vinyl and more, at a slightly reduced rate. My taste continues to shift organically and I really enjoy that. My musical highlights included [Skinshape’s Craterellus Tubaeformis](https://www.discogs.com/release/28911571-Skinshape-Craterellus-Tubaeformis), [A Certain Ratio’s 1982](https://www.discogs.com/release/26602412-A-Certain-Ratio-1982) and [Jamma-Dee’s Perceptions](https://www.discogs.com/release/28178659-Jamma-Dee-Perceptions).

[I recorded three radio shows](https://fuzzylogic.me/tags/radio/) and was pretty pleased with them, on the whole.

## Seeing friends

My April trip to London with [Tom](https://tomchurchill.com/) was a real highlight. 

There were a number of other fun get-togethers.

- Chez Simon and Nathalie in January for a post-Xmas cheesefest
- A charity race night in Kirky with Craig and Jim, where lady luck shone upon me
- Visit to Tom and Nessa’s.
- 17th March (St Pats day) went out on lash with Mark. Few places inc O’Neills then back at ours and Ailsa came.
- March me and si drink in Granary then to Andy P and Danny’s thing.
- Drinks at Sloanes for Lydia and Anna’s birthday.
- May catch-up at the Bungo for Criona and Jim’s visit.
- Cara’s first communion
- Tom G’s stag in April: where I enjoyed the Paisley food and frink festival, watched St Mirren and went to a cool local pub.
- Tom and Lou’s at Coats Paisley in late July.
- Craigy B’s birthday house-party in August
- climbing Ben Lomond with Mark and Alan.
- Sunday lunch at Jason and Lydia’s in early October
- met Mick & Laura, Tom & Nessa at Blackfriars in November
- Met Mick at the pot still one day.
- Sparklehorse and Patrick duck club.
- November friendsgiving
- Xmas: work night,
- TT night out,
- Xmas day,
- Doug & Zoe,
- Kirky boys,
- Hogmanay.

When I look at all that, I realise that I’ve done not too badly at keeping in touch with friends. Obviously there are those that I saw too rarely or not at all, and I’ll try to rectify that in the new year.

One sadder entry: in late August, my friend Simon’s mum died. It was a beautiful ceremony for an inspirational lady.

## Travel

### Abroad

[I travelled](https://fuzzylogic.me/tags/travel/) to six different countries, if you include England.

First stop was Amsterdam in June for work: I attended the CSS Day conference for the second year running. 

Also in June. Clair and I went to Sicily for Fiona’s 40th birthday, staying in Palermo then Taormina.

In August Clair and I enjoyed ten days in Geneva and Annecy.

In November [I took my parents for a week in Marbella](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/marbella-with-mum-and-dad/).

### Home 

I enjoyed a couple of trips around Scotland.

There was our March [weekend at Banchory Farm in Fife](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/weekend-at-drinkbetween-cottage/). 

Then in July I had an overnight stay in Alyth.

## Eating out

Clair and I had a lovely lunch with Charlie at Inver. 

Curry with pals at Dishoom in Edinburgh.

Crabshakk with Gillian, Tom and Nessa.

On Hogmanay, Clair and I ate at Brett and we loved it.

Special mention has to go to our evening at Café du Soleil in Geneva where we both had our first taste of fondue. 

## Family

Everything seemed to happen in June. My Aunt Elsie died – she was in her nineties and the last 10 years had seen a sad decline. 

My niece Caitlin married her partner Ross in June at Lochside House Hotel.

My niece Charlotte had her second child – Mason, a brother for Marc.

That eventful June aside, everything seems to be ticking along.

Clair is doing well and happy in her new fitness groove, which makes me happy. 

The behaviour of Rudy, our nervous border terrier, has been a mixed bag, but mostly good. There are lots of signs of improvement. At same time, Rudy went to Kate’s to see if he would hang out without pining and it went well. 

## Books

It wasn’t a productive year for reading; I couldn’t find the motivation. Still, I read:
- Open, Andre Agassi’s autobiography
- Join the Future
- The Islander

And I started The Candy House.

The good news is that they are all great, and recommended. 

## Films

I can’t remember everything I saw. I’m sure I’ll update this as my memory returns. 

However of note were Aftersun and Oppenheimer, which I saw at the GFT in July.

## Other arts

Two exhibitions in January at Tramway.

26 July saw Moorcroft at Tron. 

Celtic story revisited at Armadillo in September.

## TV

Succession finale.

Mr Inbetween.

## Other

Making coffee. Learning Spanish. 

## Work

I’m fortunate. I have a good job with great holidays. I work with smart and lovely people.

In the positive column: Brand. Accessibility. Progress and nice feedback. Empowerment of others. Three conferences: CSS Day, the in-person day of Design Systems Day in Edinburgh. And my employer FreeAgent held their second staff conference which was excellent.

In the negative column: In the latter part of the year I lost energy and focus. I couldn’t find energy to attempt to read the various blog posts I get by RSS, or write on my blog. This marked a bit of a change for me – I’m usually pretty excited and motivated in that regard.

## Health: mind and body

My physical health was fine. Weight OK. Clean bill of health at december dental check-up. I can’t remember being ill very often, although being stuck in bed with the cold on my birthday was no fun. I could always be fitter but generally speaking I’m physically fit and well. 

As for mood and mental stability, that’s more complicated. 

Firstly I’ve noticed changes to preferences and comfort zones. There are situations I used to enjoy – such as large gatherings – and now don’t. Generally I’m OK with this. It could be a post-pandemic effect, or a symptom of ageing. I don’t know the reason, but regardless it feels natural so I’m adapting to it. As long as I ensure to see people one way or another, it’s fine. 

More concerning are the too-regular occurences of low mood, low energy, frustration and mental fatigue. Working on a Design System team [can feel overwhelming](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/burn-baby-burnout/) or futile or both. Working primarily from home saves time and money but can feel claustrophobic, and combines parts of your life that should be separate. I find too many things vying for my attention and struggle to focus. My mental resilience isn’t what it was.

While low mood has a significant negative impact on me, it can impact others too. At times I’ve struggled to see the bigger picture and dropped the ball, forgetting people I should prioritise.

In summary my mental health wasn’t always great, and I had to acknowledge it. I did this to an extent; for example when at one stage I felt mentally triggered and exhausted by work, I took a couple of days off and even provided the actual reason for doing so. However that was an isolated incident and I recognise there’s a bigger issue, so I’m going to look for some professional advice. It actually feels positive to acknowledge this. My next steps will be to get some help and advice, then hopefully take some structured steps toward improving things for me and those around me.

Incidentally, I recently had an interesting chat with one of my closest friends. He was talking about things that give and take away energy, and asked what those are for me. I’ve been thinking about this a lot. In 2024 I want to do more of the things that give me energy, and less of the other.
