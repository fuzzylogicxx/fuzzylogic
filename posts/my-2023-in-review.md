## Events

In contrast to the Covid years [I attended various events](https://fuzzylogic.me/tags/event/). 

There were seven music gigs: Apiento in London, Melting Pot at Queen’s Park Rec (Luke Una and Odyssey), Melting Pot vs LGWB at BAAD in Sept, Om Unit at Sleazy’s, Robert Henke, A Certain Ratio (Nov 12) and Sleaford Mods.

Clair and I went to two weddings: Caitlin and Ross’s in June at Lochside House Hotel, then Tom and Lou’s at Coats Paisley in late July.

For work I once again attended CSS Day in Amsterdam. In addition I went to the in-person day of Design Systems Day in Edinburgh. And my employer FreeAgent held their second staff conference which was excellent.

Two funerals. At end of Aug, Simon’s mum died. Aunt Elsie.

## Hanging out with friends

One of my highlights of the year was a trip to London with Tom. 

There were some lovely less formal get-togethers. 

Simon and Nathalie’s in January for a post-Xmas cheesefest. 

Also had the race night in Kirky with Craig and Jim, a night which inclded a narrow escape. 

Visit to Tom and Nessa’s. Drinks at Sloanes for Lydia and Anna’s birthday. A May catch-up at the Bungo for Criona and Jim’s visit. Cara’s first communion. Tom’s stag in April where I enjoyed the Paisley food and frink festival, watched St Mirren and went to a cool local pub. 5th August was a party at Craigy B’s.

12th Aug climbed Ben Lomond with Mark and Alan.

Crabshakk with Gillian, Tom and Nessa.

I’m early October had lunch at Jason and Lydia’s. On Sat 11th Nov met Mick and Laura, Tom & Nessa at Blackfriars. 

17th March (St Pats day) went out on lash with Mark. Few places inc O’Neills then back at ours and Ailsa came. 

Met Mick at the pot still one day.

Sparklehorse and Patrick duck club.

Xmas: work night, TT night out, Xmas day, Doug & Zoe, Kirky boys, Hogmanay. March me and si drink in Granary then to Andy P and Danny’s thing.

## Travel

[I travelled](https://fuzzylogic.me/tags/travel/) to six different countries including England and also enjoyed a couple of trips around Scotland.

Stayed at drinkwater farm early March. 

Went to Alyth in July during summer Fridays. 

Geneva and fondue!

Marbs in November. Will be visiting more.

## Eating out

Clair and I had a lovely lunch with Charlie at Inver. Curry with pals at Dishoom in Edinburgh.

## Family

Everything seemed to happen in June. My Aunt Elsie died – she was in her nineties and the last 10 years had seen a sad decline. 

My niece Caitlin got married.

My niece Charlotte had her second child – Mason, a brother for Marc.

Rudy: At same time, Rudy went to Kate’s to see if he would hang out without pining and it went well. 

## Books

Read Open by Andre Agassi.  

## Music

[I recorded three radio shows](https://fuzzylogic.me/tags/radio/) and was pretty pleased with them, on the whole.

## Films

Aftersun

21 July went to see Oppenheimer at GFT. 

## Other arts

Two exhibitions in January at Tramway.

26 July saw Moorcroft at Tron. 

Celtic story revisited at Armadillo in September.

## TV

Succession finale.

Mr Inbetween.

## Other

Making coffee. Learning Spanish. 

## Work

Some good things happened. Brand. Accessibility. Empowerment of others.

In the latter part of the year I really lost the energy to attempt to stay on top of all the blog posts I get by RSS, or to write on my blog. This was a bit of a change – I’m usually pretty excited and motivated in that regard.

## Health and mood

Physical health fine. Weight OK. Clean bill of health at december dental check-up. I can’t remember being ill too often, although being in bed with the cold on my birthday was a bit of a damp squib. Could always be fitter but physically all’s well. 

As for mood and mental resilience, that’s a bit more complicated. 

I’ve noticed changes. Some situations I used to be comfortable in, I’m now not. Some things I used to want to do or go to, I now don’t. Generally I’m OK with this.

More concerning is the slightly-too-regular occurence of low mood and low energy.

Mental health wasn’t always great, and this needed to be (and has been) acknowledged. 

Work can feel either overwhelming, futile or both.

Events going on elsewhere in the world feel too horrendous to fully engage with beyond a few charity contributions. I’m not happy about that but it’s a symptom of how already tired I’ve felt.

It actually feels positive to acknowledge poor mental health and call it out. 

The next steps are to take more structured steps to 

Energy: what gives and takes away.
