Magical sounds in the mix, from Auld Reekie’s finest.

Other Lands consistently plays amazing records. 

He’s also been cultivating a quirky but cuddly radio voice which, combined with the heartfelt electronic sounds, makes for a warm and fuzzy listen.

This two hour show is notable for featuring lots of amazing music from Glasgow and Edinburgh, including tracks by Being, Lord of the Isles, a cut from the Off-World Transmissions LP on Invisible Inc, and a preview of the forthcoming Mac-Talla Nan Creag sequel on Firecracker.

Gav also plays both sides of [the new Nuclear Family EP](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/surface-noise) and I'm chuffed for our record to feature in this company.
