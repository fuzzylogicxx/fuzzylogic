Last month I scooped some brand new music, a couple of great releases I’d missed in 2019, and some killer reissues.

Here’s the lowdown.

## Oscar Weathers – We're Running Out Of Time

I heard this slice of reissued eighties electrofunk while tuned in to Radio 6 Music. The original is a much-sought after rarity but fortunately it’s now available again thanks to Fantasy Love Records. This features a great vocal accompanied by Funkadelic-style synths, live bass and horns, for something pretty unique.

Current Favourite Track: We're Running Out Of Time

## Skinshape ‎– I Didn't Know

A lovely dubbed out slice of psychedelic soul from Will Dorey aka _Skinshape_, whose work I first encountered on the [Riddim Box Dub / Soul Groove](https://www.discogs.com/Stally-The-Breadwinners-Skinshape-Riddim-Box-Dub-Soul-Groove/release/4772794) 7″ on Horus back in 2013. The version I heard first (on Gilles Peterson’s radio show) is the dub, however I’m warming to the vocal too. I’ve also noticed that he’s [released a few albums](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3395378-Skinshape) which I plan to check out.

Current Favourite Track: IDK Dub

## Sleep D – Rebel Force

I’ve noticed that a lot of my recent favourites originate from Australia: artists like Ewan Jansen, Rings Around Saturn and Turner Street Sound; labels like Ken Oath Records. This LP from Sleep D – who previously contributed
_Connexion Dub_ on the excellent [Sweet Echoes Vol 1](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Sweet-Echoes-Vol-1-/release/12873209) – was produced in Melbourne but released on Anthony Naples’ Incensio label toward the end of 2019. It’s on the deep, heady techno and electro tip and I noticed it has been getting some plays from Hessle Audio luminaries Ben UFO and Joe.

Current Favourite Track: Twin Turbo

## Benoit B – Caution 9′6″ High

Another excellent release from Edinburgh’s Unthank (sister label of Firecracker) featuring four tracks ranging from oddball electronics to more dancefloor-oriented electro.

Current Favourite Track: Coconut Groove
