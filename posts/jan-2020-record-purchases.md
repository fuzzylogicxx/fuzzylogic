Last month’s vinyl haul included brand new music, a couple of great releases I’d missed in 2019, and some killer reissues.

Let’s dive in.

## Sleep D – Rebel Force

I’ve noticed that a lot of my recent favourites are from Australia: artists like Ewan Jansen, Rings Around Saturn and Turner Street Sound; labels like Ken Oath Records. This LP from Sleep D – who contributed _Connexion Dub_ on the excellent [Sweet Echoes Vol 1](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Sweet-Echoes-Vol-1-/release/12873209) – was produced in Melbourne but released on Anthony Naples’ NY-based Incensio label toward the end of 2019. It’s on the deep, heady techno and electro tip (but also features a lush deep house remix from Kuniyuki) and has been getting some plays from Hessle Audio luminaries Ben UFO and Joe.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Twin Turbo

## Bella Vista – Mister Wong

Originally released in 1982, this electronic pop oddity has been reissued by <span class="nobreak">Adelaide</span>-based label Isle of Jura. The original with its quirky vocals, synths and guitars is a bit like a French _Genius of Love_, while there’s also a lovely stripped-back and effects-laden dub version.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Disco Dub (Jura Soundsystem Extended Edit)

## Roy Ayers – Searching / One Sweet Love To Remember

Vibes legend Roy Ayers’ 1976 rare groove classic _Searching_ gets a welcome 7″ reissue from UK label Dynamite Cuts. _One Sweet Love_ on the flip – also from the Vibrations LP – sees Roy in more upbeat mode with great swinging, syncopated drums.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Searching

## Oscar Weathers – We're Running Out Of Time / Countdown

A stellar slice of reissued eighties electrofunk which I heard while tuned in to 6Music. The original is a much-sought after rarity but fortunately it’s now available once again thanks to Fantasy Love Records. It features a cool vocal accompanied by Funkadelic-style synths, live bass and horns, resulting in something pretty unique.

## Skinshape ‎– I Didn't Know

A lovely 7″ slab of dubbed out, psychedelic soul from Will Dorey aka _Skinshape_, whose work I first encountered on the [Riddim Box Dub / Soul Groove](https://www.discogs.com/Stally-The-Breadwinners-Skinshape-Riddim-Box-Dub-Soul-Groove/release/4772794) release on Horus back in 2013. The version of _I Didn’t Know_ I heard first (on Gilles Peterson’s radio show) is the dub, however I’m warming to the vocal too. I’ve also noticed that he’s [released a few albums](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3395378-Skinshape) which I plan to check out.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> IDK Dub

## Benoit B – Caution 9′6″ High

Another excellent release from Edinburgh’s Unthank (sister label of Firecracker) featuring four tracks ranging in style from oddball electronics to more dancefloor-oriented electro.

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Coconut Groove

## Various ‎– DB12 002

Obscure and limited various artists release from Rimini-based label Duca Bianco, featuring a variety of electronic sounds; some poppier than others. The track _Sequence Fiction_ I bought it for is a 100 BPM chugging John Carpenter-esque instrumental that came to my attention via [Joe’s excellent mix for Crack Magazine](https://soundcloud.com/crackmagazine/2019-mix-joe) (at [7:05](https://soundcloud.com/crackmagazine/2019-mix-joe#t=7:05)).

<b>Current Favourite Track:</b> Guillaume De Bois – _Sequence Fiction_

## Joy O – Slipping

I’m really enjoying Joy Orbison’s journey as a producer and loved the 2018 7″ _Diamonds_  under his Sin Falta pseudonym. This occupies a similar glitchy and heady space and showcases some really interesting sounds and ideas while still having enough oomph for DJs and dancefloors of taste.
