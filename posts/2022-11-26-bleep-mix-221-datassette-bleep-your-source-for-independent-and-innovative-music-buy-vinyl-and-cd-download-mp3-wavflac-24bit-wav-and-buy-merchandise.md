Great DJ mix by one of my favourite electronic producers, Datassette.

> This mix is all about that 160bpm+ energy that first inspired me to make music. Around 1996 â to me at least, with the advantages of teenage naÃ¯vety â it seemed like electronic music had burst into a whole new tempo range, where there were no rules and anything was possible - as long as it BELTS (which is still true). If you go beyond 200 BPM, you reach that zone where 16th notes start to dissolve into 32nds and your brain latches onto a whole new outer layer of rhythm, like a fractal or temporal shepard tone. There is still much to be discovered!

I listened to this one while walking through the Glasgow Necropolis during one of those eerily-quiet Covid-era days, and it definitely woke me up!
