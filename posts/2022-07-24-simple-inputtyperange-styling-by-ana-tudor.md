Ana demonstrates how to achieve a range slider effect accessibly, using web standards and without needing to reach for libraries.

As [Anaâ€™s tweet explains](https://twitter.com/anatudor/status/1549284325765554176), this offers a number of features and benefits:

- can drag thumb with JS disabled
- receives focus
- keyboard navigation
- clicking track moves thumb there and changes slider value
- seen as slider in Accessibility panel
- no library needed, so less code in total
