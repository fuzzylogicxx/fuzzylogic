This handy tool is a bit like Postman but for RegEx. You can create RegEx patterns and save them for easy retrieval later. 

I also like the way you can start by making a list of example text strings you want your pattern to i) match and ii) not match, so that youâre building your pattern in a sort of âTest Driven RegExâ style.
