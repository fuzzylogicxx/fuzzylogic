Heather suggests that in developersâ excitement to do cool new stuff and use cool new tools and techniques âwe stopped letting people do very normal web thingsâ. Things like:

- the ability to copy text so you can then paste it
- ensuring elements which navigate also behave like normal links by offering standard right-click and keyboard shortcut options etcâ¦ which is to say please use the anchor element and leave it alone to do its thing
- providing a working back button
- providing scrollbars. Relatedly, allowing users to get to the links at the bottom of the page rather than having infinite scrolling results which mean the footer is always just beyond reach
- letting the browser autocomplete form fields
