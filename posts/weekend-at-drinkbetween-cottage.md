Me, Clair and Rudy just enjoyed a lovely weekend break. We stayed at [Drinkbetween cottage on Banchory Farm](https://www.banchoryfarm.co.uk/general-5). While only 70 minutes drive from home it provided some lovely countryside isolation, with the bonus of nice nearby towns to visit nearby too.

The cottage has recently been restored by the farm owners and was the perfect environment to relax. 

Our nearest neighbours were some colourful pheasants, a flock of sheep and three highland cows grazing in the fields opposite. Beyond them, there was a view onto the firth of forth and Forth bridges. Not far from home, but in the middle of the countryside. Bliss!

On the Saturday we enjoyed a short trip to the nearby towns of Aberdour via Burntisland, and moseyed down to the lovely Silver beach where we stopped for a coffee at [Sands](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g551742-d3472542-Reviews-Sands-Aberdour_Fife_Scotland.html)https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g551742-d3472542-Reviews-Sands-Aberdour_Fife_Scotland.html.

Clair brought and made beautiful food and at night we watched [Captain Fantastic](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/captain-fantastic/)https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/captain-fantastic/.

It was a reminder of just how great a well-needed change of pace and scenery you can get in a short distance and space of time.
