> No CMS, no installation, no server, no coding required.

Another quick and clever way of creating a website; this time by collecting a bunch of files (HTML, video, images, bookmarks) into a folder, connecting Dropbox and _Small Victories_ to that, choosing a theme and Hey Presto, you have a website. 

I could see this as maybe being useful for some sort of transient campaign idea that doesn’t need a CMS and that you want others to be able to collaborate on.

Note: to get a custom domain and host CSS and JS files, you need to sign up to a paid plan, but at $4/month or $36/year it’s pretty cheap.
