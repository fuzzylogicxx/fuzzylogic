On arriving home on Friday morning after the dog walk I had received some records in the post. I recently deleted my Discogs wants-list and to help bring that particular chase to an end had noted the last key remaining collection gaps and started plugging them. One of those was The Blue Nile’s _Tinseltown in the rain_ – a classic slice of Scottish pop with beautiful production – and I enjoyed a brief listen before heading out.

First stop was to pop into Greater Govanhill’s office and collect their latest edition (more on this later). On Fridays, Gomo Kimchi is open so I paid them a visit for lunch. I resisted my usual urge to order everything on the menu, opting instead for a kimchi toastie which was delicious.

During my work’s “summer Fridays off“ period I like to fit in one short trip and overnight stay and this was that day. So next I made the one hour drive to Kippen, stopping in at the lovely [Woodhouse farm shop and café](https://www.thewoodhousekippen.co.uk) en route for coffee and a slice of apple pie.
