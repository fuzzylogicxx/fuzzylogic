Nathan (of [EightShapes](https://eightshapes.com/)) discusses how to unify anatomy and props across code and design tools.

I love this article. It tackles some difficult, real problems that occur during the process of trying to align design and development but proposes interesting ways of mitigating them.

I particularly like the idea of adding a formal “API planning” step to the component creation process, and that it’s carried out by a designer and engineer pair, and that it’s documented using a standardised template that can be iterated.

This idea not only tackles those difficult language and conceptual discrepancies between design and code perspectives on a component, but also provides a means through which:

> developers and designers naturally connect

I’d like to explore this idea further at work in our Design System team.
