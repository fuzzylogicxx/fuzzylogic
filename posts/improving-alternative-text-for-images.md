Some colleagues at work have recently been asking interesting questions about “good/appropriate alternative text for images”. I definitely reckon it’s a topic worth revisiting because it feels like the landscape has changed a bit on this front over the years.

I think the web design industry has traditionally been:

1. lacking knowledge of how to write good alternative text.
2. too quick to decide which images are “purely decorative”, or accurately described by a matter-of-fact short label when maybe they actually should convey their inherent tone and emotion to all users rather than only those with no visual impairments.

But as inclusion-centric practioners we can probably do better. In his blog post [Writing great alt text](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/great-alt-text/) Jake Archibald breaks down the considerations. I reckon it’d be useful for us to dissect this post and try to boil it down to some practical rules-of-thumb for our teams.

But also, I’ve just noticed a couple of interesting developments at the big players. Firstly, [Twitter have upped their image `alt` game](https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1501603777006260226) and are encouraging their users to try doing so, too.

And hot on the heels of Twitter’s announcement, I now see in Slack an _Edit file details_ option for adding image descriptions. It’s great that Twitter and Slack are doing this… and also serves as a reminder that tools such as Slack and Twitter are consumed on the web and so accessible best practices apply when you’re writing content on them, too!
