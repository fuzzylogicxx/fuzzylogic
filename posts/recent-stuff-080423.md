I’ve been:

- reading [The Islander](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9781788705776) by Chris Blackwell and Paul Morley
- watching [Oppenheimer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/) on the big screen and [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) on TV
- listening to [1982](https://www.discogs.com/release/26602412-A-Certain-Ratio-1982) by A Certain Ratio and Matt Wilde’s [Hello World](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/matt-wilde-hello-world/)
- out to see [Moorcroft](https://www.tron.co.uk/shows/moorcroft-2/) at the Tron and thinking about it ever since
- enjoying collaborating and socialising with teammates in the office but not loving the commute
- at one wedding (Lou and Tom) and one funeral (Aunt Elsie)
- losing sleep while Rudy goes through a night-whines phase
- starting to re-find some form at table tennis training
- wanting to write regular posts like this – this is the test run!
