Here’s a handy tool from the smart folks at 9elements for making a value – such as a font-size, or margin – _fluidly responsive_. In their words the tool…

> calculates the CSS clamp formula to interpolate between two values in a given viewport range.

It’s inspired by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) but is for situations when you only need a single clamp formula rather than one for each interval in a type or spacing scale.

Beyond that, the website for this tool just looks great and is choc-full of tricks. It uses some snazzy CSS, includes [Zach Leatherman’s details-utils web component](https://www.zachleat.com/web/details-utils/) for animated disclosures and is [made with](https://github.com/9elements/min-max-calculator) Astro, Svelte and PostCSS.
