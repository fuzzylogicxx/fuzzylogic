Well that was a fun weekend!

First up on Saturday was lunch with my niece Chloe at Gusto and Relish (we thought it might be nice for her to visit the southside). We had a good blether about her wee boy Leo, her future plans and more while enjoying some tasty sandwiches and coffee. After that Chloe visited our flat which provided a chance for her to chat with Clair and meet Rudy.

Later that night was an event Clair and I had planned for a while – our [Traitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Traitors_(British_TV_series)) night with friends! We assembled at Church on the Hill where Clair took on the role of host Claudia while I, Marty and Jenny, Simon, Gillian, Tom and Nessa, Mark, Martin and Izzie, Dan and Sarah were the participants. 

We all chucked a tenner into the pot as an incentive to spice it up, then Clair set about blindfolding us and tapping the shoulders of those she’d picked as traitors. I was a faithful but ended up being voted out first! Cracking one too many jokes in the WhatsApp beforehand was my downfall, I think. That aside it all went really well and we didn’t even get launched by the unsuspecting bar staff for our theatrics. The winners also donated the cash to charity which was a really nice touch.

Competition aside, it was just lovely to catch up with people. In particular I hadn’t seen Dan and Sarah for ages. I enjoyed hearing about their recent visit to Cork (I now fancy visiting too) and also Sarah’s positive ideas about how Glasgow city centre can rise again.

We knocked it on the head at a good hour and resisted the urge for a nightcap – a sign of the mature adults we have all become (or something like that).
