Had such a good day yesterday [@weoutherefest](https://twitter.com/weoutherefest?s=21&t=U7_g4kzt2lqS6k_83zUQkw) with Tom, Jason and Craig.

We saw:

* Enny
* Sally (A Man Called Adam)
* Aletha

Followed by a short break for Char Sui Vermicelli at the NAM stall and a cracking coffee, then…

* Bake
* Charlie Dark
* Pearson Sound
* Alex Nut

Our absolute highlight was Charlie Dark in the forest. Amazing woodland setting and an amazing set! Charlie has such great energy both on the decks and on the mic. He played a mix of house, techno, disco and broken biznizz – right up my street! Great mixing too (aided by his old-school lollipop headphone).

Time for Rount Two!
