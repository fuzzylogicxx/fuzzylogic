Had such a good day yesterday [@weoutherefest](https://twitter.com/weoutherefest?s=21&t=U7_g4kzt2lqS6k_83zUQkw) with Tom, Jason and Craig. In the afternoon we checked Enny, Sally Rodgers (A Man Called Adam) and Aletha. We then stopped for a short break to sample the food and drink (Char Sui Vermicelli from the NAM stall and a break from beer for a cracking coffee). Our nighttime choices were Bake, Charlie Dark, Pearson Sound and Alex Nut.

The absolute highlight was Charlie Dark in the forest. Amazing woodland setting and a killer set! Charlie has such great energy both on the decks and on the mic. He played a mix of house, techno, disco and broken biznizz â€“ right up my street! Great mixing too (aided by his old-school lollipop headphone).

Time for Round Two!
