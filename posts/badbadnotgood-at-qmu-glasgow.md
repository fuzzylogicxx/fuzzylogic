Went to see BadBadNotGood with Marty, Jenni and Zippy last night, and they were fantastic.

We braved -7° conditions to meet at Tennent’s Bar on Byres Rd where we watched Argentia beat Croatia in the World Cup semi-final. Then onto the QMU, which provided a real nostalgia hit – I think the last time we were there was to see Roni Size and Reprazent in the _Brown Paper Bag_ era. 

We wangled a standing position on the balcony which was ideal as we could see the band, the visuals (lovely 16mm and 35mm film projections created specially for the music) and generally hear things much better. Each band member – drummer, bassist, saxophonist and keyboard player – are outstanding musicians, and together they’re incredibly tight. Led by drummer Alex Sowinski’s good vibes on the mic, they finished off their tour hitting all the right notes to send us into Christmas on a high.

Last thing to mention is I have BadBadNotGood to thank for introducing me to the music of [Arthur Verocai](https://undergroundsolushn.com/arthur-verocai-arthur-verocai.html), via [his amazing string arrangements on Talk Memory](https://youtu.be/BUePFld3UHo). And for that I’m very thankful!
