This slider/carousel certainly looks nice, and I like author David DeSandro’s work, having taken inspiration from his [3d Card Flip tutorial](https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/card-flip) for a recent project. I’d just like to dig into it a little further to see how it fares in terms of accessibility before using it in the wild.
