Since November last year my day job has involved working on a âMajestic Monolithâ coded in Ruby on Rails. I really enjoyed this conversation with Railsâ creator in which he raises some really interesting points about finding a programming language that speaks to us, why single page apps and microservices are not for him, and how our working days have too many interruptions.
