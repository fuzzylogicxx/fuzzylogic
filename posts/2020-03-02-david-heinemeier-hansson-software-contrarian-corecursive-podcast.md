Since November 2019 my day job has involved working on a “Majestic Monolith” coded in Ruby on Rails. I really enjoyed this conversation with Rails’ creator in which he raises some really interesting points including finding a programming language that speaks to you; why single page apps and microservices are not for him; and how our working days have too many interruptions.
