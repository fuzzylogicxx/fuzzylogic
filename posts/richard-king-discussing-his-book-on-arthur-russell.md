A nice (if brief) catch-up with Gav as we take in David Barbarossa in conversation with Richard King about his new book [Travels Over Feeling](https://www.faber.co.uk/product/9780571379668-travels-over-feeling/) on the life of enigmatic New York musician Arthur Russell.

I love me some Dinosaur L and Loose Joints, but I can’t claim to be as much of an Arthur aficionado as most of tonight’s crowd. However I’ve learned a lot and am now off to listen to [World of Echo](https://arthurrussell.bandcamp.com/album/world-of-echo).
