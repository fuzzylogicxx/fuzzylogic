This post from earlier this year offers a similar encouraging message to Henny Swan’s recent [_The only accessibility specialist in the room_](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/the-only-accessibility-practitioner-in-the-room/). It contains advice that’s worth remembering when we have one of those ”what’s the point?’ moments!

Advice like:

- Get started; don't wait until everything is done and perfect 
- Small steps make a big difference
- Educate, don't berate
- Think of accessibility as an ongoing journey with no finish line
