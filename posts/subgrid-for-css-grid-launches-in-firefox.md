Subgrid for CSS Grid Layout has [arrived in Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/12/firefox-71-a-year-end-arrival/) and it looks great. Here’s how I wrapped my head around the new concepts.

While MDN has [some nice examples](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid), I generally find I need a little extra time, trial and error and note-making in order to fully grasp CSS Grid concepts. 

For example, I always need to remind myself that parts of the syntax – e.g. in `grid-template-columns` selectors – refer to grid _lines_ rather than the columns themselves. 

So I created a [Subgrid example pen with guideline notes](https://codepen.io/fuzzylogicx/pen/eYmpowG?editors=1100) for future reference. Note: make sure to open the pen in Firefox rather than any other browser, because at the time of writing only Firefox supports Subgrid!
