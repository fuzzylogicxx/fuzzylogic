Here are my quick links and tips (that I can use whereever I am) for creating a blog post using github.com. Why do I create posts this way? Because I’ve tried Forestry and Netlify CMS and I don’t have the time or inclination to maintain dependecies for them or change in line with their updates. I’ve also found them a little flaky. So instead let’s see how this lo-fi approach works.

This post is mainly for my own reference but who knows, maybe it’ll be useful to someone else too.
