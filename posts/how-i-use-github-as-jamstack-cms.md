Here are my quick links and tips for creating a markdown-file-based blog post using only github.com and no CMS. I’ve put these on this site so that they’re on the web therefore I can access them wherever I am.

Why do I create posts this way? Because I’ve tried forestry.io (now _Tina_) and Netlify CMS and I no longer have the time or inclination to maintain their dependencies, load their JavaScript or make ongoing updates as they evolve. I’ve also found them a little flaky. So instead let’s see how this lo-fi approach works.

This post is mainly for my own reference but who knows, maybe it’ll be useful to someone else too.

Step 1:

[Create a new markdown file in my posts directory](https://github.com/fuzzylogicxx/fuzzylogic/new/v3/posts)

Step 2: use one of these previous posts as a template (open, copy then paste into my new markdown file):

- [Standard blog entry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzylogicxx/fuzzylogic/v3/posts/collected-web-accessibility-guidelines-tips-and-tests.md)
- [Bookmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzylogicxx/fuzzylogic/v3/posts/add-opacity-to-existing-color.md)
- [Short note](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzylogicxx/fuzzylogic/v3/posts/captain-fantastic.md)
- [Note with photo](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/fuzzy-logic-laurence-hughes-march-23-clyde-built-radio/)
- [Book I’ve started reading](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/i-ve-started-reading-the-15-minute-city-by-natalie-whittle/)
