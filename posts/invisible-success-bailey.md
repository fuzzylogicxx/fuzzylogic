Here’s Eric Bailey with some very relatabe thoughts on the need to tell Design System stories even though it’s difficult because good Design System work can feel invisible.

<blockquote>
  <p>The component works. And because it works, nobody pays attention to it.</p>
  <p>This is the promise of a design system made manifest: Consistent, quality experiences for complicated interactions, distributed at scale with minimal fuss.</p>
  <p>This is objectively great. The problem, however, is how we talk, or fail to talk about this type of success.</p>
</blockquote>

> A lack of bug reports, accessibility issues, design tweaks, etc. are all objectively great, but there are no easy datapoints you can measure here. By this, I mean it is difficult to quantify a void.

Eric advices thinking about aspects of design system work that are not directly about components, but are also critical part of it:

<blockquote>
  
  - Identifying and collecting various ways to weave compelling narratives about the invisible, successful work you’ve done, and then
  - Putting those stories in front of the people who need to know them.

</blockquote>

At work we are currently working on that very thing with as part of a communication strategy.

Sidenote: Eric introduces the problem frames this in the context of a [Data table component](https://primer.style/components/data-table) he recently worked on for GitHub. It looks good! This is also highly relatable, because I built one of these a few years back, too, and know how much work is involved.
