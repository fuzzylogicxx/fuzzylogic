No holiding back from Jeremy Keith here:

> I understand how itâs useful to have the stats and numbers to hand should you need to convince a sociopath in your organisation, but when numbers are used as the justification, youâre playing the numbers game from then on. Youâll probably have to field questions like âWell, how many screen reader users are visiting our site anyway?â (To which the correct answer is âI donât know and I donât careââeven if the number is 1, the website should still be accessible because itâs the right thing to do.)
