Here’s [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/), making the moral case for accessible websites and why we shouldn’t use “you can make more money by not turning people away” as an argument:

> I understand how it’s useful to have the stats and numbers to hand should you need to convince a sociopath in your organisation, but when numbers are used as the justification, you’re playing the numbers game from then on. You’ll probably have to field questions like ”Well, how many screen reader users are visiting our site anyway?” (To which the correct answer is “I don’t know and I don’t care” – even if the number is 1, the website should still be accessible because <em>it’s the right thing to do</em>.)
