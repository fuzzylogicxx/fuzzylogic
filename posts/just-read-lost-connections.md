When I chatted with a consellor in January I described one symptom of my recent bouts of low mood and mental fatigue as a weird sense of _disconnection_. The recent lockdowns during the covid pandemic were obvious contributors to that but didn’t feel like the full story.

Reassuringly it turned out I’m far from alone in feeling this way, since one of her suggestions was to read Johann Hari’s bestselling book Lost Connections: why you’re depressed and how to find hope.

On the whole I really enjoyed this book – well as much as you can enjoy a book about depression!
