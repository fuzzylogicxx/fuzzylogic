Here’s a lovely slow-mo comparison of Liam Pitchford’s technique versus that of an amateur.
---

The main things I take from it are: 

* his posture – really low with weight forward
* how far in front of his body he strikes the ball – it’s way in front of his head and even in front of his non-playing hand, with impact at the back edge of the table
* the bat angle at the start (forehand side facing ceiling like you’re holding a frying pan) 
* as he prepares, the bat’s left edge tilts up a bit and he gets slightly lower
* uses wrist to bring bat tip way back to point back at his belly button
* then it’s a little forearm but a lot of wrist rotation to reach impact
* stays low and on follow through bat only reaches chin-height
