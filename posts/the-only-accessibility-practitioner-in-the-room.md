Henny Swan, director at Tetralogical, with some great advice for those who accessibility responsibility falls to alone.
---

Henny advises:

On _responsibility_: accessibility is everyone’s responsibility all the time, not just your responsibility all the time.

On _relationship-building_: build relationships with decision-makers with authority to embed accessibility and practitioners ready to build up their skills.

On _sustainability and scalability_: look for ways to scale what you do through demonstration and documentation.

On _expectations_: manage expectations and be clear about what you can do. You can give advice, but teams themselves need to make informed decsions. Also – you won’t know everyting, and sometimes you need the help of expert consultancy.

On having _support_ to hand: build a support network through community groups and mentor programmes.
