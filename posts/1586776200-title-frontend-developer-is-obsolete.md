I have to reluctanctly agree on this one. I‚Äôve interviewed quite a few candidates for ‚Äúfront-end developer‚Äù (or similarly named) positions over recent years and the recurring pattern is that they are strong on JavaScript (though not necessarily the right time to use it) and weak on HTML, CSS and the ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üßµ It&#39;s time for our industry to realize the title &quot;frontend developer&quot; is obsolete. The vast majority of these profiles are actually &quot;JS engineers&quot;, and they&#39;re usually quite good at it, but they&#39;re not as good at all the other things contributing to great frontend experiences.</p>&mdash; Benjamin De Cock (@bdc) <a href="https://twitter.com/bdc/status/1249597086007345157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
