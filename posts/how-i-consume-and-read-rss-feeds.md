I’m currently interested in how to spend less time on social media platforms so as to be less at the mercy of their algorithms. One means of doing so might be to go back to the old school and pull in content from the people I follow via RSS, allowing me to review it in a central place rather than having to go browsing. There are many means of consuming RSS feeds – here’s what I’m using.

I use the free, open source Mac and iOS app [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) on my MacBook. This is where I tend to organise my RSS feeds as it has a good UI, for example for arranging feeds into relevant folders.

If I want to browse my feeds elsewhere (on my iPhone, or on another computer), I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) – either the website or the iOS app.

NewsNetWire and Feedbin sync pretty seemlessly together. 

Feedbin is paid (I currently pay 5 USD per month). It has a slick UI and, since it’s available from anywhere, could be treated as your “central hub” for reading. 

Feedbin also offers a couple of interesting features.

Firstly, you can use it to subscribe to email newsletters, because it provides you with an email address for that purpose.

Secondly, you can subscribe to Twitter accounts, and choose to filter them by only those with links or media attached (in theory the “more interesting” tweets).

Note: many thanks to Chris Coyier whose post [NetNewsWire and Feedbin](https://css-tricks.com/netnewswire-and-feedbin/) pointed me toward these excellent feed clients.
