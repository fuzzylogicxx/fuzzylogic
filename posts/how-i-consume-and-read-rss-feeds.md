I’m currently interested in how to spend less time on social media platforms so as to be less at the mercy of their algorithms. One means of doing so might be to go back to the old school and use RSS to pull in content from the people I follow, allowing me to review it in a central place rather than having to go browsing. There are many means of consuming RSS feeds – here’s what I’m using.
---

I use the free, open source Mac and iOS app [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) on my MacBook. This is where I tend to organise my RSS feeds as it has a good UI, for example for arranging feeds into suitable folders.

If I want to browse my feeds elsewhere (on my iPhone, or on another computer), I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) – either the website or the iOS app. NewsNetWire and Feedbin sync pretty seemlessly together so any organisation I’ve done in NetNewsWire is visible in Feedbin.

Feedbin is paid (I currently pay 5 USD per month). It has a slick UI and, since it’s available from anywhere, could be treated as your “central hub” for reading. 

Feedbin also offers a few very interesting features.

- You can use it to subscribe to email newsletters, because it provides you with an email address for that purpose. This means you can have your newsletters arrive into the same central place as your RSS feeds;
- You can subscribe to Twitter accounts, and choose to filter tweets by only those with links or media attached (in theory the “more interesting” tweets); 
- there’s a “Send to Feedbin” bookmarklet that essentially provides a one-click “Read later” function for use when browsing the web. This is a really handy feature because sometimes when I’m browsing the web I want to mark an article as “read later” rather than bookmarking it on my website, because until I’ve read it I won’t know if it’s bookmark-worthy. Having this feature destresses online life a little by stopping me leaving lots of browser tabs open at articles I “need to read”! I previously used Instapaper (and their bookmarklet) for this function, but again, it makes sense for me to bring everything into one place (Feedbin);
- You can “star” (i.e. save) items you’ve read but want to revisit, which is handy when browsing your “Unread” list away from your laptop; and
- You can “share” items to well-known services (Twitter, Facebook etc) but interestingly also to a “custom service” by providing a URL. I could see me using this in future to bookmark an article on my own website.

Note: many thanks to Chris Coyier whose post [NetNewsWire and Feedbin](https://css-tricks.com/netnewswire-and-feedbin/) pointed me toward these excellent feed clients.
