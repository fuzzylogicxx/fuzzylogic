We just enjoyed a lovely festive visit to Doug and Zoe’s house where we hung out with them and their girls Zara and Nina. As an unexpected bonus our friend Pablo also stopped by.

After the rush and stress of organising Christmas it was just what the doctor ordered. Doug made a delicious and light panzanella salad. I taught Zara how to play hangmam on good ol’ pencil and paper. We enjoyed a chat and a laugh.

Cheers, pals!
