Recently, during a period when pandemic woes were taking their toll and likely making me a little cranky at home, I found some funny and helpful words of wisdom on Adam Buxton’s podcast and when re-watching Ricky Gervais’s interview with Larry David.

On sustaining a happy marriage, [Buxton said](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/wmcgmfe7zj7chps-89fa4-2e48e-rwzy8-824b8-4mdjd-2hcs8-chrb2-7y8jj-5pcse-2wtsh-cz8zd-e3cdy-g68s7-3dezn-7k5mw):

> Every now and then you think “they’re not doing what I _want_ them to do and I think it’s important that they _do_ do this thing that I want them to do! (But) you have to think really hard: is this thing actually _important_? Is it worth getting bent out of shape about?

It’s good advice. He mentioned that he’s slowly getting better at that, and I’m trying my best to, too.

Meanwhile, on the reasons why he got into acting, [Larry David said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL0m8BmxNq8):

> it gets you out of the house!

So simple but true—it’s good to get out of the house! We’re now emerging from a period of sustained isolation and I should probably avoid being completely remote (and going stir crazy) and get back into the office occasionally.
