Here’s a comprehensive and great-looking CSS reference featuring lots of examples.

While these days I normally reach for [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to keep me right on any given CSS feature, I’ve been thinking that with the recent explosion of new CSS features and syntax it’d be great to do a refresher course by working my way through a structured list of features—just like I did with Eric Meyer’s [CSS: The Definitive Guide](https://meyerweb.com/eric/books/css-tdg/) back in the day—and Codrops’ reference could be the perfect place.

In a similar vein, the [CSS-Tricks Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/) looks good and [cssreference.io](https://cssreference.io/) is worth bookmarking, too.
