Basecampâmakers of project management, team communication and email softwareâhave taken a controversial new stance against (amongst other things) political discussion at work, âpaternalistic benefitsâ and 360 performance reviews.

> These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work. It's become too much. It's a major distraction. It saps our energy, and redirects our dialog towards dark places. It's not healthy, it hasn't served us well.

On the surface I can see the appeal of âkeeping it simpleâ in the workplace during an era when so many different things vie for our attention. However the move to âsilence conversationâ feels out of step with a moment whenâas a societyâweâre trying hard to correct institutional, longstanding inequalities. Perhaps the channels where political/societal discourse can happen need better demarcated and the âhouse rulesâ properly set. But especially after the year weâve just had it also feels wrong to take a dictatorial approach toward staff.

It seems that [many departing employees feel the same way]((https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/basecamp-employees-quit-ceo-letter/) ).
