It’s taken a few years, but me and Tom are excited to be releasing a new record on our label, [The Nuclear Family](https://nuclearfami.ly/).

[Check out the audio previews](https://soundcloud.com/the_nuclear_family/sets/tnf-003-surface-noise-clips).

Titled _Surface Noise_, our third release will be available on both 12″ vinyl and digital, hitting all good record stores in early November ‘18.

You can [pre-order it now from our Bandcamp page](https://the-nuclear-family.bandcamp.com/album/surface-noise).

Here's what our press release says:

Artist: The Nuclear Family vs Other Lands
Title: Surface Noise
Label: The Nuclear Family
A: The Nuclear Family - Surface Noise
B: Other Lands - See Thru Time

Did you miss us? The Nuclear Family - Tom Churchill and Laurence Hughes - are back after a three-year hiatus, and this time we’ve roped in one of our good buddies, [Other Lands](https://www.discogs.com/artist/6118087-Other-Lands), to help us deliver a double-header of deep delights for discerning DJs and dancers, cut nice and loud over a full side each.

Surface Noise, on side A, is the first of the Family’s recent studio jams to see the light of day, with its classic 808 drums and analogue bass underpinning warm pads, twinkling melodies and some subtle vocoder flourishes.

On the flipside, we’re honoured to present a killer track from Other Lands - aka Edinburgh’s veteran DJ/producer Gavin Sutherland, fresh from the success of his recent Pattern Transform 12” for Firecracker and all manner of other exciting studio and live projects. See Thru Time is a masterclass for the heads, with mellifluous chord progressions and a timeless groove.

TNF 003 will be available on vinyl via Rubadub in November, along with a digital version via Bandcamp.
