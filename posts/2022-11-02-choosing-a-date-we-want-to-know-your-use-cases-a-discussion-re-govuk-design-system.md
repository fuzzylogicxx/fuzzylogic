> We want to find out if adding a 'date picker' component to the Design System is a good idea.

> We're currently looking for: examples of date pickers in services: screenshots, prototypes, links to live services; use cases: explanations of why a 'date picker' was used in a service instead of a 'date input', or something else; research: how well 'date pickers' tested with users to complete different tasks.

This discussion thread will be really helpful for everyone attempting to create an accessible Date Picker.
