The GOV.UK Design System is a nice Design System success story. At 3 years old it’s reporting high traffic, usage and satisfaction ratings. GDS do so much great, thoughtful and inclusive work (which they also share with the community) and it’s inspiring to see it being a success.

> There are now more than 900 live cross-government services using the GOV.UK Design System - 75% more than a year ago. It’s being used in more than 2,600 repositories on GitHub and has been forked more than 200 times.
