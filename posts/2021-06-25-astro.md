Astro looks _very_ interesting. Itâs in part a static site builder (a bit like Eleventy) but it also comes with a modern (revolutionary?) developer experience which lets you author components as web components or in a JS framework of your choice and then renders those to static HTML for optimal performance. Oh, and as far as I can tell theres no build pipeline!

> Astro lets you use any framework you want (or none at all). And if most sites only have islands of interactivity, shouldnât our tools optimize for that?
