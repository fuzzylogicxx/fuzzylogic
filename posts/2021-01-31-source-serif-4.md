Hereâs a nice demo page for Source Serif 4 which illustrates its versatility.

> Source Serif is an open-source typeface for setting text in many sizes, weights, and languages. The design of Source Serif represents a contemporary interpretation of the transitional typefaces of Pierre-Simon Fournier. Additionally, Source Serif has been conceived as a friendly companion to Paul D. Huntâs Source Sans.

Back when I first started using Source Sans Pro as the body font for my personal website, I tried using Source Serif for headings. It didnât work then but seems to have undergone some changes since then and also has a variable font variant. I might give it another try.
