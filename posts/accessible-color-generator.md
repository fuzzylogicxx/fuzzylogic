There are many [colour contrast checking tools](https://fuzzylogic.me/tags/contrast/) but I like this one from Erik Kennedy (of [Learn UI Design](https://learnui.design/)) a lot.  It features an intuitive UI using simple, human language that mirrors the task I’m there to achieve, and it’s great that if your target colour doesn’t have sufficient contrast to meet accessibility guidelines it will intelligently suggest alternatives that do.

I’m sure everyone has their favourite tools; I just find this one really quick to use!
