Just had a memorable midweek night at the cinema with Craig and Jason.

[Opus](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/28/ryuichi-sakamoto-opus-review-neo-sora) presents Ryuichi Sakamato at the piano in the final year of his life. It consists of him playing twenty pieces one after the other and is beautifully shot in black and white by his son, Neo Sora.

I found the film’s style and starkness to be quite unusual at first, but once I got into its rhythm it was very immersive. The music and playing were at times just mesmerising and given the circumstances it was quite moving.

It was great to unexpectedly bump into [Liam](https://liamnugent.me/), too. I might have known this film would be up his strasse!
