Link characteristics 

* go somewhere

Button characteristics

* do something
* form (more flexible because can [include HTML content](https://www.buttoncheatsheet.com/))
* also 

Experiential differences

* announced differently
* users have different expectations of the two. By this I don’t only mean the general “links go somewhere” and “buttons do something” but also in terms of their accessibility and interactivity.
