> Using one element or set of elements (usually because of their functionality) and styling them to look like something else is a common pattern [â¦butâ¦] it creates a mismatch between the actions people expect they can take and the ones they actually can.

LÃ©onie tackles the prickly subject of âelement re-purposingâ in web development. This followed a [fantastic Twitter exchange started by Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1545712667515654144) regarding whether the UI design of âadjacent but mututally exclusive buttonsâ should be built as radio buttons or using button elements.

Lea has also gathered her thoughts and decisions into a blog post [What is the best way to mark up an exclusive button group?](https://lea.verou.me/2022/07/button-group/) _and_ shared a new [`button-group` web component](https://github.com/LeaVerou/nudeforms/tree/main/button-group)!
