> Using one element or set of elements (usually because of their functionality) and styling them to look like something else is a common pattern […but…] it creates a mismatch between the actions people expect they can take and the ones they actually can.

Léonie tackles the prickly subject of “element re-purposing” in web development. This post follows a [fantastic Twitter exchange started by Lea Verou](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/1545712667515654144) regarding whether the common visual design request for “adjacent but mututally exclusive buttons” should be built as radio buttons or using `<button>` elements.

Relatedly, [Lea](https://twitter.com/LeaVerou) has also gathered her post-discussion thoughts and decisions into a blog post [What is the best way to mark up an exclusive button group?](https://lea.verou.me/2022/07/button-group/) _and_ shared a new [`button-group` web component](https://github.com/LeaVerou/nudeforms/tree/main/button-group)! 

Thank you so much, Lea and Léonie.
