My generous nieces and nephews clubbed together to give us the Christmas present of a voucher for [Ox and Finch](https://www.oxandfinch.com/). Keen to use it, we got together with James and Grant for a lovely Sunday dinner.

It’s a “small plates” affair, so sharing is the order of the day. We had sourdough and butter (the bread in good restaurants is always amazing), whipped feta with honey, fried artichokes with garlic yoghurt, and – my two favourites – the crab tubetti and beef tartare. To drink I had a white wine – the ‘le campuget’ grenache viognier – then their _px old fashioned_ (the _px_ standing for pedro ximénez). 

We also shared the warm ginger cake with poached pear, while James had the affogato. 

It was fantastic and – thanks to that thoughful gift – didn’t cost us a penny. What a great Christmas present.
