Enjoyed the lively little party-not-party at Jason and Lydia’s last night.

I didn’t manage a whole lot of time chatting with either of the busy hosts, especially as I kept It sensible and didn’t stay too long. But they seemed in good form. And I managed to catch up with Craig and Anna, Mick, Aldo and Ritchie amongst others. Mick was telling me about how many gigs he has lined up this year (including for The The and Jane Weaver) and making me jealous.

The hosts’ new kitchen and living room layout was looking really great too.
