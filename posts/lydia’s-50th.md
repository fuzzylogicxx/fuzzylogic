Enjoyed the lively little party-not-party at Jason and Lydia’s last night.

I didn’t manage a whole lot of time chatting with either of the busy hosts, especially as I kept It sensible and didn’t stay too long. But they seemed in good form and Lydia seems well recovered from last year’s shoulder operations. I did managed to catch up with Craig and Anna, Mick, Aldo and Ritchie amongst others. Mick was telling me about how many gigs he has lined up this year (including _The The_ and _Jane Weaver_) and making me jealous.

The hosts’ new kitchen and living room layout was looking really great too.
