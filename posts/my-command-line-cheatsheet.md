Hereâ€™s a list of useful terminal commands for my reference and yours.
---

## Using iTerm2 (Terminal Emulator)

### Composer

Make editing long lines easier by using Composer. 

Open Composer: <kbd class="block">Shift-Cmd-.</kbd>

Type your long command and enjoy using standard text editing controls:

<figure>  

``` bash
git commit -am "A very long commit message"
```

</figure>

Send Composer command to terminal: <kbd class="block">Shift-Return</kbd>

### Snippets

<kbd class="block">Toolbelt > Show Toolbelt</kbd>

Then add, edit and delete commands.

Select a command then use `Send` to insert it on the terminal.
