Hereâ€™s a list of useful terminal commands for my reference and yours.

## iTerm2

### Composer

Make editing long lines easier by using Composer. 

Open Composer: <kbd>Shift-Cmd-.</kbd>

Type your long command and enjoy using standard text editing controls:

<figure>  

``` bash
git commit -am "A very long commit message"
```

</figure>

Send Composer command to terminal: <kbd>Shift-Return</kbd>
