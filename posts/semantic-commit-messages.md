A fairly rigid commit format (`chore`, `fix`, `feat` etc) which should lead to your git log being an easy-to-skim changelog.

Here’s how to use the different commit types:

```
chore: add Oyster build script
docs: explain hat wobble
feat: add beta sequence
fix: remove broken confirmation message
refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
style: convert tabs to spaces
test: ensure Tayne retains clothing
```

I’d noticed that my git commit messages could benefit from greater consistency. So I’m started adopting Sparkbox’s approach.
