> On the page, right-click the element you want to debug event listeners for, then click _Inspect Element_. In chromium-based browsers like MS Edge and Google Chrome, click the _Event Listeners_ tab in Developer Tools. There, you’ll see a list of all of the events being listened to on that element. If you expand the event, you can see what element they’re attached to and click a link to open up the actual event listener itself in the JavaScript.
