The idea of accessibility literacy (having the right vocabulary, knowing the trustworthy info sources etc) makes sense.

The section on _Accessibility ignorance and ableism_ presents some home truths about organisational attitudes to accessibility that need addressed.

> Accessibility ignorance actually goes beyond just a lack of accessibility literacy. **Accessibility ignorance is a facet of ableism, since it causes people to make decisions that actively harm disabled people.**
>
> * Accessibility ignorance isn't usually malicious.
> * It's assuming that accessibility is taken care of because your organization has an accessibility specialist on staff, or has accessibility "baked in" to a design system.
> * It's providing accessibility training for only teams that build products and not people that work in support, legal, operations, leadership, or other parts of the organization.
> * It's expecting accessibility work to happen without impacting schedules and roadmaps that didn't originally take accessibility work into account.
> * It's assuming disabled people don't use your product.
> * It's not hiring disabled people.
> * It's hiring disabled people but only to do accessibility work.
> * â€¦
