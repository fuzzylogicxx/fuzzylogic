I’ve seen a couple of other developers use [photos from Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) in their demos, and it just came in handy for me recently when needing some free food photography for a website.

It’s choc-full of lovely – and free – high-res photographs, offers a simple URL-based pattern for embedding, and has an API so will be really useful.
