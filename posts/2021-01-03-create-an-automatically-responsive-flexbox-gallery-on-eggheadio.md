Hereâs a lovely intrinsically responsive (i.e. requires no media queries) photo gallery solution from Stephanie Eckles. It can accommodate differently sized images and achieves its goal using a combination of flexbox features (such as `wrap`, and squishy items with an ideal width via `flex-basis`) plus `object-fit: cover` to tell images to fully _cover_ their parent list items.
