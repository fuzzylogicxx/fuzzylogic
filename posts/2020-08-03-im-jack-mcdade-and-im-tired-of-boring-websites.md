So many fun touches in this design! It gave me quite a few chuckles when browsing it over the weekend.

My favourite bits were the “Email Deposit Box” on the [Radical Design Course section](https://radicaldesigncourse.com/) (make sure to have sound turned on) and the entire [Design Work](https://jackmcdade.com/design) page (keep scrolling)!
