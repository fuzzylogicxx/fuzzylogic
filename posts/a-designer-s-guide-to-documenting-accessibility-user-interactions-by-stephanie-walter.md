My teammate Colin just shared this brilliant designers’ guide to documenting accessibility and user interactions. It’s really thorough and includes some pretty clever annotation techniques.

I agree with Stephanie that unless you ask the questions and document the answers regarding how a design will translate to an accessible reality then it can fall short at lots of points from the start to the implementation. This called to mind a similar, brilliant article by Sophie Beaumont on [how the BBC shift left regarding accessibility](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/2021-05-24-shifting-left-how-introducing-accessibility-earlier-helps-the-bbcs-design-system-or-by-sophie-beaumont-or-bbc-design-engineering/). 

This type of annotation and discussion also feels like another healthy way for designers and engineers to talk to (and learn from) each other more.

I really like Stephanie’s conclusion that you won’t always have time for all of the techniques she mentions, so pick your battles.
