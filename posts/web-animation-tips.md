There are lots of different strands of web development. You try your best to be good at all of them, but it ain’t gonna happen—there’s only so much time in the day! Animation is an area where I know _a little_ but would love to know more, and from a practical perspective I’d certainly benefit from having some ready solutions to common challenges. As usual, I’d also like to favour web standards over libraries as far as possible and take an approach that’s lean, accessible and performs optimally.

Caveat: this is a living document which will evolve over time. 

Animation on the web describes a visual change that occurs over a period of time rather than instantly.
