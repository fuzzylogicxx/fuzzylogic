Jamie (<abbr>aka</abbr> [Bud Burroughs](https://twitter.com/burroughsbud) of Stirling’s [Jelly Roll Soul](https://www.facebook.com/jrsscotland/) crew) kindly invited me to DJ with him at [Max’s Bar](http://maxsbar.co.uk/) last Saturday night (21st July ‘18).
</p>

We played from 9pm–3am. Max’s was rammed to the rafters as usual and it was fun to have six hours to play with, going through the gears and playing different styles and tempos. We also had some friendly faces for company – not only was it Jason Brunton’s birthday but we also had Chris Reid over from Italia and on the birras!

Music-wise, it was cool to mix on the <abbr>DJR</abbr>-400 and I particularly enjoyed playing <abbr><em>EXU</em></abbr>, the new one from Patrick Pulsinger & Irl:</p>

Jamie played lots of tracks I liked, including an upbeat version of _Space Jungle Luv_ by Oneness-Of-Juju that I would post but can’t find anywhere!
