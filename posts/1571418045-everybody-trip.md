Original 1979 copies of Garden of Eden’s *Everybody’s on a Trip* regularly sell for £200+ so I was pretty happy to hear that it had just been reissued on Backatcha records… and even happier when I managed to snag a copy.

I first heard this stellar slice of deep funk a few years back on Kon and Amir’s compilation *Off Track Volume One: The Bronx*, and have been hankering after a proper copy ever since.

Check it out!
