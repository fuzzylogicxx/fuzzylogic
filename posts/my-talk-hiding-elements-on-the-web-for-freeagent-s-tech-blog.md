I recorded a talk on “Hiding elements on the web” for [@freeagent](https://twitter.com/freeagent)’s tech blog. It’s a tricky [#FrontEnd](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FrontEnd?src=hashtag_click) & [#a11y](https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y?src=hashtag_click) topic so I try to cover some good practices and responsible choices. Hope it helps someone. (Also it’s my first video. Lots of room to improve!)
