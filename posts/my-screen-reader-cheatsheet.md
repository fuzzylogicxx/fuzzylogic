Here’s a list of useful Screen Reader commands and tips for my reference and yours. This is a work in progress and I’ll update it as I go.

## VoiceOver (Mac)

### Initial setup:

Open Safari > Preferences > Advanced then check “press tab to highlight each item on a webpage”.

### Usage

- Open target page in Safari as normal.
- <kbd>Cmd-F5</kbd> to turn VoiceOver on.
- <kbd>Cmd-F5</kbd> (again) to turn VoiceOver off.

Get “toggling on and off” via the keyboard shortcut into your muscle memory.

Then:

- <kbd>Ctrl-Option-A</kbd> to have VoiceOver read the entire page.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to pause VoiceOver, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> again to resume.
- Tab through items on the page using the tab key. This will move to the next focusable item (button, link, input).

#### Quickly jump to specific page elements

- <kbd>Ctrl-Option-U</kbd> to open Rotor
- Browse categories using left and right arrows. This includes the _Landmarks_ menu.
- Down arrow to browse within the categories

### Tables
- Navigate to a table using <kbd>Ctrl-Option-Cmd-T<kbd>
- It should read a caption and give you info about the size of the table
- <kbd>Ctrl-Cmd-{arrowkey}<kbd> to navigate inside the table.
