A tool for testing how accessible your experience is on various assistive technologies – perhaps like BrowserStack but for screen readers?

> Assistiv Labs remotely connects you to real assistive technologies, like NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack, using any modern web browser.

I use a Mac for development which means that when I do screen reader testing I use the Macâs VoiceOver tool. However the majority of screen reader users are using NVDA via Firefox on a PC. Perhaps this tool might let me test on that stack without buying a PC.

Next action: sign up for a free trial and give it a go!
