I’ve just read _1984_ by George Orwell. I know, I know… I should have done this a long time ago. Anyway, here’s what I thought.

I remember a copy of _1984_ being around the house when I was growing up but for some reason I never got around to reading it. I did, however, see the film when I was young – the “Room 101” scene in particular being unforgettable – and have always known the general plot. 

On a recent work trip I realised while in the airport shop that I’d left a book at home so it seemed like as good a time as any to pick up a copy of _1984_ and scratch this particular itch.

As a book about a dystopian future, I knew it would be dark, but it was even darker that I imagined. The constant sense of dread was really palpable.

I loved the concepts Orwell created – the Two Minutes Hate, doublethink, Thought Crime, Room 101 to name but a few.

I also loved the language in general and the appendix, _The Principles of Newspeak_.</p>

And even though it was heart-wrenching and pretty harrowing, I loved the final descent into brainwashing (or “re-education”) and ultimately, betrayal.

This was an amazing book that I loved reading, while not necessarily always being ”enjoyable”.
