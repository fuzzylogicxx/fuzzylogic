Prior to Christmas we’d been talking about giving ourselves the present of a trip to London. However the train prices were pretty offensive so we opted for a different type of weekend trip – one that was rural, cosy and Rudy-friendly.

Friday’s check-in wasn’t til 4pm so we started with a drive to North Berwick. There, we visited the Lobster Shack. Clair had fish and chips while I had seafood chowder (which Clair admitted was the pick of the dishes). The weather was of the good January sort – chilly but sunny so we had a wee stroll along the beach and let Rudy have a run.

[Charlton Gate cottage](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/51219157?source_impression_id=p3_1706962399_4Fe%2BGwkjVw%2BncR1l) was perfect. We were in splended isolation, except for the neighbouring sheep and grouse. The cottage itself was comfortable with all the cooking and telly-watching facilities you’d need, plus a comfy bed.

On Saturday we visited Newbiggin-by-the-sea for more beach-walking fun.

Later that day we also paid a brief visit to Morpeth, which is a lovely town.

I really enjoyed my morning walks with Rudy. It was so peaceful and the sky and scenery were beautiful.

Thanks as always to my fam Clair and Rudy for a beautiful weekend.
