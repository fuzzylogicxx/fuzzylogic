Farewell Rutger Hauer; famous for his roles in Bladerunner, The Hitcher and the Guinness ads. They were undoubtedly great… however in 1989, for a 13-year-old boy at the height of a ninja obsession, he was _the man_ as Nick Parker in Blind Fury, a film about a blind war veteran who is implausibly handy with a samurai sword and goes on to defeat Sho Kuzugi in the final showdown. It was daft, but I loved it.
