Absolute gold here regarding accessibility, bloated components, and purpose versus appearance.

> Itâs easy for a component to become bloated and its purpose increasingly ambiguous.

The article also makes a fundamental point.

When you need a new piece of UI, just because an existing component looks similar does not mean it is appropriate. Itâs tempting, and reusability is a key goal, however on the web how something looks is only part of the story. 

A well-built component built to take whatever is thrown at it will have been constructed to convey meaning and purpose at a lower-level than the visual (CSS) level, and to provide that to both non-visual and visual environments.

Thatâs why sometimes the existing component is not a fit, because the meaning/purpose required for the new thing is different to that of the existing thingâ¦ and bloating the component to change itâs meaning is bad for maintainability and reusability.

This is great advice for comparing and choosing between components:

> Focus on what components achieve rather than their appearance
