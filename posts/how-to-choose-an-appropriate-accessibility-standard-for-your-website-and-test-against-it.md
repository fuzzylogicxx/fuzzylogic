## Which should I choose for a commercial website?

WCAG 2.1 level AA

You might argue that regardless of the law there is a moral imperative to do the right thing.
But as to the law:

https://info.webusability.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-law-on-accessibility:
“The accessibility of a UK web site is covered by the Equality Act 2010… Site owners are required to make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to make their sites accessible to people with disabilities.
…there is no legal precedent about what would constitute a ‘reasonable adjustment’. 
However, given that the Government has adopted the WCAG 2.1 level AA as a suitable standard for public sector sites (see below) and it is more broadly recognised as a ‘good’ approach, any site which met these guidelines would have a very strong defence against any legal action."

"The most common and widely-accepted standard to test against is WCAG, a.k.a. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. 
This standard created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines technical guidelines for creating accessible web-based content. 
WCAG Success Criteria are broken down into different “levels of conformance”: A (basic conformance), AA (intermediate conformance), and AAA (advanced conformance). 
The current standard for compliance is both WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA.
If you don’t have specific accessibility regulations that apply to your organization but want to avoid legal risk, WCAG 2.1 A and AA compliance is a reasonable standard to adopt."
