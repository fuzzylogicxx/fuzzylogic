I’ve been listening to lots of jazz of late and [loved seeing Herbie Hancock live in August 22](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/herbie-hancock-at-edinburgh-playhouse/).

So I thought I’d explore further and listen to [the audio recording of Herbie’s autobiography Possibilities](https://books.apple.com/fr/audiobook/herbie-hancock-possibilities-unabridged/id1531547010), narrated by the great man himself. 

I really enjoyed it. Herbie’s story is really interesting and entertaining. He’s been at the forefront of so many iconic scenes – from playing in Miles Davis’s band, to writing many classics (now jazz standards) himself, to breaking new ground with his Mwandishi xxx and Headhunters groups.

I love his carefree and curious spirit and his willingness to experiment with technology (from the fender Rhodes, to other synths, to the internet) and take risks in other aspects of life. 

What a talent and what a guy!
