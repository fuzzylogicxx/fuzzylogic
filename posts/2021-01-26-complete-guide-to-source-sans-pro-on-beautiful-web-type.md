At the time of writing, my personal website uses the typeface _Source Sans Pro_ and has done for around two years. I already employ a number of its cool features however this lovely demo page provides further inspiration.

> Source Sans Pro is a versatile typeface designed particularly for user interfaces. Its letterforms are slightly condensed allowing them to fit into tight spaces within a UI, and remain well-defined even at small sizes.

I might consider going back to using Source Serif Pro for headings again, too.
