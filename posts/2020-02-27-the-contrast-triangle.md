> Removing underlines from links in HTML text presents an accessibility challenge. In order for a design to be considered accessible, there is now a three-sided design contraint - or what I call "The Contrast Triangle". Your text, links and background colors must now all have sufficient contrast from each other. Links must have a contrast ratio of 3:1 from their surrounding text. This is so that colorblind users can tell what pieces of text are links. By not using underlines, a design has to rely on contrast alone to achieve this.

Itâs interesting that Chip says that this level of contrast is needed âwhen we donât use underlines on linksâ.

So this seems to be yet another good reason to include underlines in links, i.e. if you underline your links then you donât need to worry quite as much about a third level of contrast.

Indeed, when you toggle on the âShow underlinesâ option in this tool, it removes the requirement to ensure additional contrast between hyperlinks and standard body text.

However, even if your links in flowing prose are underlined, thereâs always likely to be places (Navigation, Footer, CTAs etc) where links probably wonât be underlined for design effect, so I reckon this is useful for most websites. (via https://twitter.com/jamesmockett)
