The last week was challenging at work. A minor restructure is underway and with it the possibility of redundancies. My job isn’t at risk; it affects team and group managers rather than me directly. But it will impact upon people I know, like and respect. It may also lead to teams merging or disbanding altogether so there’s an air of unease. 

To unwind after that week, Friday night consisted of watching Scotland play Finland at Hampden. A 2–2 draw to send Steve Clarke’s men off to the Euros.

On Saturday morning I headed to [Cathkin Braes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathkin_Braes) for a walk with Rudy. What a view you get up there! You can see pretty much the entire city, and even beyond as far as Ben Lomond.

Later that day I visited Davie at his mum’s place in Troon. He’s over visiting from the U.S. following George’s death. I spent a little time chatting with Marguerite. Her garden is really beautiful. 

Davie and I went to [River Garden Cafe, Auchincruive](https://www.rivergarden.scot/the-bothy-cafe) for a lovely lunch and walk. We chatted about family and life in general. From there we had a drive around some of his old haunts in Ayr including a stop at [Renaldo’s](https://renaldosayr.co.uk/) for ice cream.

bad news about Mel, magic dinner at Maison Glaschu, drop Rudy at gran’s, FHC father Louis, back at M&L’s in BofA, dinner at home.
