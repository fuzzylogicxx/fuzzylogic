The last week was challenging at work. A minor restructure is afoot and with that comes the possibility of redundancies. It affects team and group managers rather than me directly, but will impact upon people I know and like. It might also lead to teams merging or disbanding altogether so there’s an air of unease. 

To unwind after that week, Friday night consisted of watching Scotland play Finland at Hampden. A 2–2 draw to send Steve Clarke’s men off to the Euros.

On Saturday morning I headed to Cathkin Braes for a walk with Rudy. What a view you get up there! You can see pretty much the entire city, and beyond as far as Ben Lomond.
