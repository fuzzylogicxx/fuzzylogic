How to break out to full-bleed, various ways.
---

Adactio mentioned this article https://joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/.

Then followed up with https://kilianvalkhof.com/2020/css-html/full-bleed-layout-using-simple-css/ (Dave Rupert has kind of done this before? https://daverupert.com/2017/03/full-bleed-with-not/)

- margin-left: 50%;
- transform: translateX(-50%);
