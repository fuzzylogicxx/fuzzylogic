I had a brilliant time hanging out with old friends this evening. We went for a Sunday roast dinner at Maison Glaschu. I tried french onion soup for the first time (but not the last) before enjoying the roast beef and yorkshire pudding with veg.

It was sunny so we stopped for a quick alfresco beer at The Bier Halle before heading down to [the Admiral Woods](https://theadmiralwoods.com/) to watch Scotland in the hope of a historic first-time qualification from the group stage.

Sadly Scotland couldn’t manage it (too cautious with the substitutes for me) but that didn’t stop us having a good time. 

Cheers to Craig, Debbie, Alan, Karen and Mark for all their good vibes.
