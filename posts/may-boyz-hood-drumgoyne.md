With Clair off having fun in Skye, the boys (me and Rudy) have been spending some quality time together. On Friday night we watched Dune 11. Rudy wasnâ€™t too bothered but I really enjoyed it. It looks absolutely stunning, especially the all-white gladiator scene. And I thought the heavy, growling soundtrack marked a return to form for Hans Zimmer.

On Saturday with the sun shining we walked up Drumgoyne Hill which was steep but fun, before getting home in time to watch Celtic beat Rangers to (just about) clinch the league title.
