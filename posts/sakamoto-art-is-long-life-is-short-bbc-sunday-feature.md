> He was a prince. 

Alejandro Innaruto’s description of Ryuichi Sakamoto puts it perfectly. 

This BBC Sunday feature offers a fascinating insight into an amazing man. I loved it!

It starts with how 1952, the year of Sakamoto’s birth, was an important year in Japan’s post-war transition. It explores his influences including Debussy, his exceptional talent for melody combined with a taste for experimentalism, and how with YMO he satirised anti-Japanese prejudice. It covers his anti-nuclear stance, and how he is a huge icon in Japan where they see him holistically for everything he represented.

Most of all I just marvel at his music – I can’t think anything that better captures my taste. I loved the parts where the commentators gush at the beauty of his Last Emperor soundtrack and when Alejandro Innaruto relates his experience of first hearing the opening two notes of his soundtrack for _The Revenant_.
