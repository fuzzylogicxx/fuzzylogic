I was introduced to this website and service by Val Head’s An Event Apart Talk “Building more expressive projects”.

TunnelBear describes itself as “A more secure way to browse the web” and it does this by encrypting your internet connection to keep your online activity private on any network.

More interestingly to me, it succeeds at making a techy subject friendly by the use of illustrated and animated bears. And who doesn’t like bears?
