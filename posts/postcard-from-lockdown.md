I found this postcard from Lockdown. (Actually it’s a post-it note however that doesn’t sound as good). It provides a record of a difficult moment. I must have felt moved to empty my thoughts on paper either for my own sanity or to help me gather my thoughts to confide in someone, likely Clair.

Minimal time out of the house.
