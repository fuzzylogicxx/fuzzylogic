I just watched “Larry’s Garage” – a film about the visionary New York DJ, Larry Levan and the legendary nightclub he called home.

Unfortunately there’s precious little footage of this infamous New York club and the stuff they included I’d seen before, but there was some nice previously unseen interview footage with Larry Levan and overall, although I wasn’t blown away, I enjoyed it.
