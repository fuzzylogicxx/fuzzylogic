> Is online advertising working? We simply donât know

---

This article reveals that despite $273bn being spent on digital ads globally (figures from 2018) the effectiveness of digital advertising is actually borderline impossible to measure and it is highly likely that any favourable figures suggested by marketers owe more to the âselection effectâ and blind faith.

I donât particularly enjoy being followed around the web by âtargeted adsâ, but especially so when you discover that the intrusion is relatively pointless!
