I just made a first visit to Chicago. It was primarily to attend [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com/) but I was lucky enough to have a little time to check out the city, too.

Firstly I have to thank all the friends who provided tips for things to do and see in The Windy City ‚Äì Aleks, Susan, Jenny, Lucy, Alan and Karen, Collette etc ‚Äì cheers!

Thanks also to [Davie](https://www.instagram.com/daviec7/) for jetting in from <abbr>NYC</abbr> to join me and [Liam](https://twitter.com/liamjnugent) for a couple of days. I doff my cap to your knowledge of beautifully designed restaurants with really expensive menus üòâ.

I also got the chance to catch up with old friend Nick Calingaert <abbr>AKA</abbr> <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/173-Common-Factor">Common Factor</a>, a lovely guy and talented producer who DJed for me and my friends at a couple of our club nights back in the early 00s.

Here‚Äôs some of the things we did. I hope that these tips are useful to someone else.
