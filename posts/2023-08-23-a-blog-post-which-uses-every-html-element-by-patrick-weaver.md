An interesting article which helps the author – and his readers – understand some of the lesser-used and more obscure HTML elements.

While Patrick confesses he is still learning certain things and therefore I won’t regard his implementations as 'gospel' in the way I would an article by someone with more HTML and accessibility expertise such as Adrian Roselli, I see this as another useful resource to help me when deciding whether or not an HTML choice is the semantic and or correct tool for a given situation.

Thanks, Patrick!
