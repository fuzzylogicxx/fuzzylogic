Growing up I was never a fan of nature programmes so didnt pay too much attention to Chris Packham but in the last few years I've grown fond of him. That's in part due to his revelations about his punky musical leanings, but probably more so his candid description of is autism and work to bring the nature of autism into the public eye and help others.

He is also quite inspirational in trying to do the right thing in so many ways, despite significant challenges.

This was an enjoyable interview but some of the parts about his losing animals and dark moments make for tough reading. Still though, I'm now considering reading [Fingers in the sparkle jar](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/fingers-in-the-sparkle-jar-a-memoir-chris-packham/3973406?ean=9781785033506)
