Roderick E.J.H. Gadellaa, author of the Webventures blog writes that at their June 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) Apple announced that it will bring Web Push to Safari, including iOS Safari.

> MacOS is going to get it first and iOS will receive it in a later iOS 16.x update, sometime in 2023.

This could be a big deal, because…

> Web Push on iOS will change the “we need to build a native app” decision.

I don’t like the idea that native mobile apps are superior to mobile web experiences, nor the notion that by having a native app you can ignore your small-screen web experience. PWAs and native apps can co-exist in harmony and address different use cases. But also web APIs are becoming more powerful all the time, and this announcement by Apple provides fuel for the argument that “you might not need a native app for that!”
