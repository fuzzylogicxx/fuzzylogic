Having pre-recorded previous shows, I recently made a first visit to [Clyde Built Radio’s](https://www.clydebuiltradio.com/) station at the Barras market for a live show and really enjoyed it. It’s such a great location and it was a nice change to spin records on a Sunday morning.

I started off gently with atmospheric music from Detroit’s Ian Finklestein followed by a modern take on Steve Reich from Bitchin Bajas. From there it was into some hazy electronics and a dash of 80s boogie before landing on sounds from house music legends Abacus and Larry Heard.
