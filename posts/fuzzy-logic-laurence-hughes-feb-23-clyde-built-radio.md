I recently made a first visit to [Clyde Built Radio’s](https://www.clydebuiltradio.com/) station at the Barras market, having recorded previous shows at home. I really enjoyed it. What a great little space!

It was lovely to spin records on a Sunday morning, and I started suitably mellow with some atmospheric solo piano from Detroit’s Ian Finklestein flowing into a modern take on Steve Reich from Bitchin Bajas. From there I moved into some hazy electronics, added a dash of 80s boogie then landed on house music royalty with sounds from Abacus and Larry Heard.

Here’s the tracklist for my mix:

1. Ian Finklestein – Ago-ra
1. Bitchin Bajas – Amorpha
1. Isotope 217 – Audio Boxing
