The best SL-1200/10 set-up video Iâve seen

I especially like the section on testing for channel imbalance by playing a mono record using a mono record (such as [Nat Birchall's Upright Living LP](https://www.discogs.com/release/15752593-Nat-Birchall-meets-Al-Breadwinner-Upright-Living) and comparing the output meter for any differences between left and right, then untightening the relevant tonearm screws in order to make adjustments.
