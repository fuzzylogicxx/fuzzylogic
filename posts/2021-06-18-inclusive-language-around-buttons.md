[@Amy_Hupe](https://twitter.com/Amy_Hupe) recently posed a great question on Twitter regarding inclusive language for buttons:

> What's an inclusive way to describe what you do to a (digital) button, given it might be pressed with a mouse click, a screen tap, a key on a keyboard, and so on? I've tended to use "select" but wondering if that's right?

There are a lot of good suggestions and my takeaway is that:

1. it dependsâwhatâs right for one context may not be for another; and
1. there are a few good ones.

My favourites are:

- use; 
- âclick or tapâ; and _maybe_
- press (which may work as a common abstraction).

I also liked Craig Abbotâs observation:

> itâs actually a bit weird to describe the physical interactions anyway. It should be intuitive. If a button says continue, itâs pretty obvious you need to interact with it. If you need to explain the UI usually thereâs a bigger problem.

Iâm not such a fan of these suggestions:
- select; and
- activate
