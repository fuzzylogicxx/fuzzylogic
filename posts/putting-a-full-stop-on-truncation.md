At work we’ve recently been shown a couple of design proposals where truncation was presented as a solution to the perceived problem of long and unwieldy content, for example a long description in a table cell. However following good discussions, as a wider team we’re now leaning towards avoiding truncation as an approach. Truncation [can present accessibility issues](https://www.tpgi.com/the-ballad-of-text-overflow/) and as Karen McGrane says [truncation is not a good content strategy](https://freeagent.slack.com/archives/C37K79GCA/p1656058527349639?thread_ts=1656058159.790969&cid=C37K79GCA). I reckon we should just let long content wrap, and design for that to look OK.
