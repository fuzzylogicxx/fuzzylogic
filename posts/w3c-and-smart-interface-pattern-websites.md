Two lovely new websites (or website updates) appeared on my radar this last week that I wanted to note here for future front-end inspiration. 

Vitaly Friedman’s [Smart Interface Patterns](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/) has had some lovely animation and component work from Clearleft alumni [Cassie Evans](https://www.cassie.codes/) and [Trys Mudford](https://www.trysmudford.com/). Given Vitaly’s obsession with creating accessible, user-friendly components and the collaborators he has on board, I expect this site to be choc-full of well crafted nuggets for reference! It looks ace, too.

I noted a while ago that [the W3C had a new Design System](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/w3c-design-system/), and now [the W3C has a new website](https://beta.w3.org/) in beta too. I imagine it might use components from that Design System alongside other carefully-considered patterns of markup, style and behaviour.

Nice job on these sites, to all concerned!
