The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) have just published a new Design System. It was developed by British Digital Agency [Studio 24](), who are also working (in the open) on [the redesign of the W3C website](https://www.studio24.net/work/working-in-the-open-with-w3c/).

My initial impression is that this Design System feels pretty early-stage and work-in-progress. I’m not completely sold on _all_ of the technical details, however it definitely contains a number of emergent best practices and lots of interesting parts.

I particularly liked the very detailed [Forms](https://design-system.w3.org/styles/forms.html) section which assembles lots of good advice from Adam Silver and GOV.UK, and I also found it interesting and useful that they include a [Page Templates](https://design-system.w3.org/templates/) section rather than just components and layouts.

It’s cool to see an institution like the W3C have a Design System, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves.
