> Lean, hackable, extensible slide deck framework

I’ve been on the lookout for a lightweight, web standards based slide deck solution for a while and this one from Lea Verou could well be perfect.

It has keyboard navigation, video and code demo support, an index page and much more… and it’s all powered by straightforward HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I need to give this a spin!
