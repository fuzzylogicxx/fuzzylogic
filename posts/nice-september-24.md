left on clair birthday. Tram to lympia. Hotel la seize. Walk to gallery Lafayette then place ma… and rue ma …. Amaze lunch at maison de Marie, their formules dejeuner. Bus tour. Prom des Anglais past former casinos and grand hotels. On past the Russian Orrhidox church, the musicians‘ district, the train station and Messana Square. Villefranche etc. Cocktail at [Movida](https://www.movida.today/en/), a little drinks and tapas bar on Quai des Etats-Unis with roof seating overlooking the bay. Clair had a fiery mojito with ginger and chilli while I had a summer negroni and it was bliss. To finish, back to Rue Messana passing through Place Massena which with its beautiful colourful buildings and Spanish archicted figures is something to behold. Dinner at Oscar’s. The area is buzzing.
