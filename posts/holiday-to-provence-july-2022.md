Like most folks we didn’t holiday abroad during 2020 and 2021, when COVID was at its height. Trips abroad are a luxury and privilege so this was no hardship. However I’ll admit that once restrictions were lifted and things felt safer, we were pretty excited to head for some sun and good food, and set our sights on a first trip together to the south of France.

## The location

We spent seven nights at [Désir de Provence](https://en.desirdeprovence.com/), hosted by owners Sylvie and Igor.

## Dining out

La Bastide Bleue restaurant, Séguret.

Hotel Montmirail in Vacqueyras.

Beautiful local wine at [Domaine Mathiflo](https://domaine-mathiflo.com/) in Suzette (right in the heart of the countryside). 

Les Ramparts in Venasque – incredible nighttime view over the mountains

[Monsieur Tu](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608811-d23724147-Reviews-Monsieur_Tu-L_Isle_sur_la_Sorgue_Vaucluse_Provence_Alpes_Cote_d_Azur.html) at L’isle sur la Sorgue, where we had a lovely meal of fish and wine by the canal.

Chez Serge in Carpentras.

## Other highlights

Antiques market at Carpentras.

A day walking around the towns of Gigigondas, Seguret and Vaison La Romagne.

St Remy de Provence on a Wednesday morning for a fantastic market.

[Carrieres Lumieres](https://www.carrieres-lumieres.com/en/node/994) (caves featuring art installations) which was amazing.

Aix en Provence. [Vasarely Foundation](https://www.fondationvasarely.org/en/) for Kinetic art. Lovely shops and vibe.

[Chateau du Barroux](https://www.chateaudubarroux.fr/en/) was a stunning hilltop location with a castle, cobbled streets, a chapel and incredible panoramic views of the surrounding region including Mont Ventoux.

L’isle sur la sorgue – a lovely town which had an antiques market that blew Clair’s mind!

## If we had more time

Hopefully on a future stay in the area we can visit Gord, Russelet (“the Colorado of Provence”), and Nimmes.
