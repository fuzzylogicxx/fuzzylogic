[Rubadub](https://www.rubadub.co.uk/) have a new mobile app that delivers the RaD crew’s top vinyl recommendations (the best around) direct to your phone.

At a time when lots of vinyl releases are highly limited, this gets you early access to the latest heat before it disappears. It should also generally save untold hours browsing/searching since in their recommendations Rubadub have already done the job of separating the wheat from the chaff.

The app was developed by me and the team at [Greenhill](https://www.greenhilldigital.com/).

It was quite tricky, because aside from developing the mobile app itself there was a lot of API work needed to integrate it with Rubadub’s stock and e-commerce systems. We also built middleware specifically for machine-learning customer tastes.

The current v1 app handles the core feature of letting people listen to, save and buy records but there’s a lot of cool stuff vis-a-vis personalised messaging and taste-based recommendations on the roadmap. [I’ve written about this in more detail over on Greenhill’s site](https://www.greenhilldigital.com/portfolio/case-studies/rubadub-app).

The long-term idea is that it becomes the app equivalent of the actual record shop experience...i.e. going into Rubadub on Howard St and one of the guys/gals handing you a pile of tunes with a side of witty repartee.

If you’re a vinyl junkie like me or into electronic music in general, I recommend checking it out.
