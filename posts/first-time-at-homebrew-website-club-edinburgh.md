Recently my work colleague [Francesco](https://fran.fi/) told me about a new Edinburgh branch of Homebrew Website Club. Exciting! I unfortunately couldn’t make their first event but just attended [their second event](https://events.indieweb.org/2024/04/homebrew-website-club-edinburgh-R0PUj1pjs3wC). Here’s how it was billed:

> Join us in Edinburgh for demos of personal sites, recent breakthroughs, discussions about the independent web, and to meet IndieWeb community members!

It was good fun! Great to chat about writing, and personal websites with fellow tinkerers. I’m sure I’ll be back.
