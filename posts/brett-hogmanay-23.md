Clair and I just rounded off the year in style with lunch and drinks at [Bar Brett](https://www.barbrett.co.uk/) on Great Western Road. We had a bird’s eye view too, sat overlooking the pass watching the chefs at work.

Between us we enjoyed a variety of small dishes including oysters, sourdough bread with chicken fat butter, cod toast, smoked beetroot, clams, lobster ravioli, mushroom XO noodles, Coley with curried mussels and a Basque cheesecake.

We tried a few glasses of wine: Veiled Vineyards Old Vine Semillon (white), a Delamotte Blanc de Blancs (champagne), and Le Grand A (Burgundy white) – all lovely. 

Brett is fantastic and the staff made us feel very welcome.
