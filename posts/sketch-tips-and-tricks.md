I’ve used Sketch for a few years, having followed the lead of my designer colleagues who switched from Photoshop. As a web developer primarily inspecting and grabbing things from other folks’ designs, my level has been pretty basic. However I’ve decided to level up and get more creative. As I learn the ropes, here’s a list of useful (Mac-based) Sketch tips for my reference and yours.

## Create an Artboard

The initial _canvas_ is infinite so we need a fixed frame (representing a device screen) on which to work. 

1. Add an artboard: at top-left, choose __Insert > Artboard__.
2. Set its size: at top-right choose preset dimensions or create custom.
3. Rename your layer (at top-left) to something appropriate for the overall task (e.g. News Article, or whatever).

## Zooming and centring

For manual zoom, pinch trackpad.

Centre screen on element we’re working on: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>.

Zoom in on current object to 100% screen size: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>.

Zoom out, centred on artboard: <kbd>Escape</kbd> then <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> then <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>.

## Adding Text

Insert text element: <kbd>T</kbd>.

Then control it on the right:
- Change typeface
- Adjust text size using the _size_ field. 
- Adjust text size by decimal increments: press and hold <kbd>Option</kbd> while adjusting the size.

## Adding Shapes

Insert shape: at top-left, choose __Insert > Shape__ > ….

Insert a rectangle (shortcut): <kbd>R</kbd>.

Round a rectangle’s corners: select it, then on the right change its border radius, e.g. to 3.

For a perfect circle: insert an oval with <kbd>O</kbd> then press and hold <kbd>⇧</kbd> while clicking and dragging.

Change shape dimensions: Press and hold <kbd>Command</kbd> and the up or down arrow key. Press and hold <kbd>Option</kbd> to do so in decimal increments.

Change background: edit _fill_ on the right, selecting a solid colour or a gradient fill.

Create a custom shape like a tick: 
- at top-left, __Insert > Vector__
- draw lines using a series of points
- Use the tools on the right to tweak thickness, roundedness etc.

## Layers

Lock a layer to make it unselectable and unmovable: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>.

Make layer see-through: change its opacity by typing (e.g.) 5 for 50% or by controls on right-hand-side.

Use a blend mode to mix a layer’s background colour with it’s parent’s background colour: 
- select your layer
- select the _Colour Fill_ box on the right
- Select a blend mode such as _overlay_ or _soft light_.

## Duplicate a layer

Press and hold <kbd>Option</kbd> then select and drag element.

Additionally press and hold <kbd>⇧</kbd> to ensure alignment.

Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>

## Combine layers

We group layers together in order to select them as one and move them together. 

Select layers, then <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> (for _Union_).

Right-click and __group selection__.

## Add Rulers

Start by showing default rules using the toggle: <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

Create gutters each side (e.g. 32px) by dragging markers.

## Alignment

Select a layer or layers and use the Alignment tools at the top-right.

## Share your work

- Select artboard
- On right panel, __Make Exportable__.
- Use 1x and .png.
- Click __Export Selected__.

## Miscellaneous

See space between sibling layers: press and hold <kbd>Option</kbd> and select layer.

Move layer up or down by 10px: press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and up/down arrow key while layer is selected.

Add dummy data: select one or more layers then from top-right select __Data__ and insert names, cities or images.
