I’ve used Sketch for a few years, having followed the lead of my designer colleagues who switched from Photoshop. As a web developer primarily inspecting and grabbing things from other folks’ designs, my level has been pretty basic. However I’ve decided to level up and get more creative. As I learn the ropes, here’s a list of useful (Mac-based) Sketch tips for my reference and yours.

## Commands Quick Reference

| Task            |      Command      |  Notes              |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Add an artboard | `a`               | or `Insert > Artboard` |
| Centre screen on current element | `Command`+`2`               | |


## Key Concepts

### Create an Artboard

The initial _canvas_ is infinite so we need a fixed frame (representing a device screen) on which to work. 

| Task            |      Command      |  Notes              |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Add an artboard | `a`               | or `Insert > Artboard` |

From the top-right choose preset dimensions (e.g. _Desktop_) or create custom.

Rename your layer to something appropriate for the overall task, e.g. News Article.
