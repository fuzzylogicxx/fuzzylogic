## Key Concepts

### Starting with an Artboard

The initial _canvas_ is infinite so we need a fixed frame (representing a device screen) on which to work. 

Steps: 
1. Add an artboard. 
1. From the top-right choose preset dimensions (e.g. _Desktop_) or create custom.
1. Rename your layer to something appropriate for the overall task, e.g. News Article.
