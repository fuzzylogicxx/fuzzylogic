I’ve used Sketch for a few years, having followed the lead of my designer colleagues who switched from Photoshop. As a web developer primarily inspecting and grabbing things from other folks’ designs, my level has been pretty basic. However I’ve decided to level up and get more creative. As I learn the ropes, here’s a list of useful (Mac-based) Sketch tips for my reference and yours.

## Create an Artboard

The initial _canvas_ is infinite so we need a fixed frame (representing a device screen) on which to work. 

1. Add an artboard: at top-left, choose __Insert > Artboard__.
2. Set its size: at top-right choose preset dimensions or create custom.
3. Rename your layer (at top-left) to something appropriate for the overall task (e.g. News Article, or whatever).

## Zooming and centring

For manual zoom, pinch trackpad.

Centre screen on element we’re working on: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>.

Zoom in on current object to 100% screen size: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>.

Zoom out, centred on artboard: <kbd>Escape</kbd> then <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> then <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>.

## Text

Insert text element: <kbd>T</kbd>.

Then control it on the right:
- Change typeface
- Adjust text size using the _size_ field. 
- Adjust text size by decimal increments: press <kbd>Option</kbd> while adjusting the size.

## Duplicate an element

Hold down <kbd>Option</kbd> then select and drag element.

Hold down <kbd>⇧</kbd> to ensure alignment.

Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>

## Add Rulers

Start by showing default rules using the toggle: <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

Create gutters each side (e.g. 32px) by dragging markers.
