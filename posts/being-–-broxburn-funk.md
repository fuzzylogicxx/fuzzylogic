Being’s _Broxburn Funk_ arrived in today’s post and it’s a thing of beauty. Enjoying it now with a ☕️. Amazing work all round—music, sound, artwork, the lot. Big up [@WeeDjs](https://twitter.com/WeeDjs) for the stellar tunes and if [@firecracker_rec](https://twitter.com/firecracker_rec)’s 50th is their last, then they’ve finished with a bang.
