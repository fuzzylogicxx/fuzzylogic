## Golden Ivy - Kläppen (LP)

Beautiful sounds from Malmo that straddle the organic and the electronic, settling on something vaguely oriental. I was relieved to snap up a copy before it disappeared, given that their previous LP – _Monika_ - is as rare as hen’s teeth and still eludes me. Alas the parcel is currently languishing, unloved, on my desk at work, having arrived there from Gothenburg just a day after the office shut for the lockdown. Damn it! Good things come to those who wait…

<b>Favourite Track:</b> Klappen 11

## D.K. - Live at the Edge (LP)

My favourite release to date from Parisian producer D.K. was [his stellar collaboration with Suzanne Kraft](https://www.discogs.com/DK-10-SK-DK-SK/release/11022398) on Melody as Truth in 2017. This LP ploughs a similar sensous, ambient furrough and would have been a pretty tasty live gig (if you happened to be in Seoul at the time). Yet another great release from Glaswegian label 12th Isle, with beautiful artwork to boot.

<b>Favourite Track:</b> Untitled 11 (not yet on YouTube)

## Datassette – Existenzmaximum

 I’ve loved Datassette since [his first outing on Ai records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbXGyV4twsM) back in 2005. He’s got such a great sound – simultanesouly futuristic, funky, musical and heartfelt in a way that few electronic producers can match. This EP (from November last year but just repressed) is typically brilliant.

<b>Favourite Track:</b> Shooz Who

## Various - Gazillions

These days I try not to buy records for just one track, but this is something special. Top cut _Lotus Turbo_ by Russian duo Formally Unknown is a hard-hitting blend of electro and bass that sounds pretty fresh to these ears. This one is screaming to be played loud.

<b>Favourite Track:</b> Formally Unknown – Lotus Turbo

## Various - Bubble Chamber (LP)

I’d urge any fans of serious electro to get on this tout suite – you won’t be disappointed. It boasts a formidable line-up, featuring tracks by Gerald Donald, The Exaltics and Plant43 to name but three. The music comes from a variety of locations and eras; we get Montreal-based Iko’s 1983 track _Approach on Tokyo_ nestling alongside new music from Detroit. Kuldaboli from Reykjavík is a new name on me but offers up the pick of the bunch. Oh, and the vinyl also comes with a 56-page booklet containing previously unseen Drexciyan art by Abdul Haqq… which is nice.

<b>Favourite Track:</b> Kuldaboli – Draumur inní heilann þinn

## Max D - Many Any (LP)

Solid LP from one half of Beautiful Swimmers, taking in house/techno cuts that evoke vintage Morgan Geist and Ferox, interspersed with hip hop influences. Big up my man Gav aka Other Lands at [Underground Solu’shn](https://www.undergroundsolushn.com/) for the hot tip!

<b>Favourite Track:</b> Shoutout Seefeel
