Mark Root-Wiley explains why hover dropdown menus are confusing for users therefore better implemented as click menus.

I like the fact that it calls out that:

> When you first make this change, itâs true that some visitors might still expect hover menus. They may even say they prefer them if you ask.

But then goes on to provide some rationale (ammunition?) from various big guns on why click menus are better:

> Avoid using hover to expand dropdown lists. Hover is difficult for some users and wonât work on touch screens. Dropdowns should expand on click or with keyboard navigation.
âThe U.S. Web Design System

> What it really boils down to is user intent. The purpose of a hover state is to indicate something is clickable (underlined text)â¦ The purpose of a click is to actually do something, to take an explicit action. Opening a dropdown is an explicit action and should only happen on click.
