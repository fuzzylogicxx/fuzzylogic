Nice video here from Tom Lodziak in which coach Emma Harradine demonstrates a forehand loop that just looks _so_ spinny, safe and reliable.

I’ve always liked the idea of this shot – typical of the third ball of the rally – being like a well-oiled machine, but have never quite nailed it. So I’m gonna study this!
