Don’t treat work like an end in itself; treat it as a means to the end of fulfilling your purpose.

What are your key skills, experiences and values? Write them down, them summarise how these come together as your “core perspective” or _purpose_.

Now, we want to find ways to fulfil that purpose, and to do that we can set goals. When considering candidate goals, ask:
- Does this connect to my purpose?
- Do I actually care about achieving this goal?
- Is this a goal I can actually achieve?
- How will I know if I’m making progress?
