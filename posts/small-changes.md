Growing up, I often heard my Dad use the old Scottish phrase _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ and I’ve always loved it. It means that there’s value in collecting small things because together they form a more important thing. It seems true in ways I hadn’t even considered. Over the last six months I’ve made lots of small tweaks to how I live. It’s a work in progress but I’m seeing wider improvements and feeling better.

Here are some of my small changes to diet, sleeping patterns, self-respect and more that are working so far.

## My starting point

It’s worth relating what was going on in my life prior to making these tweaks. While there wasn’t any particular emergency there were a number of lower-level flags.

- I’d recently taken days off work for stress and mental fatigue triggered by aspects of my job. And I often found work frustrating.
- I obsessed about everything – work projects, web trends, my supposedly fun hobbies such as music – you name it. My OCD-like symptoms were counterproductive and mentally draining.
- More generally I suffered bouts of low mood which affected aspects of personal and home life. I felt tired and disconnected.
- I was getting my priorities wrong.
- I was often late to bed and struggling to rise, with knock-on effects for the rest of my day.
- I was a bit overweight.
- During and after lockdown (and partly as a result of working from home) I’d developed bad habits. I managed to be ready for work at the start of each day but generally without having considered how I ate, and having dressed lazily due to lack of time and organisation.

I guess _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ works both ways. A collection of smaller undesirable things will lead to a larger malaise. And that’s where I was.

## Healthier breakfast

I think the idea with a holiday is to unwind completely, but pervesely I like devoting some time to life admin. And it was while on holiday last August with time and space to reflect and think creatively that I started making changes.

Clair told me about scientist and author [Tim Spector’s ideas about diet, avoiding harmful blood sugar spikes, and gut health](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/25/eat-fibre-first-and-ditch-the-juice-five-quick-and-easy-tips-for-a-much-healthier-meal). Up til then I’d thought it was relatively healthy to drink a glass of Tropicana every morning, and hadd done so for years. Upon learning the short and long term sugar-related impacts I decided to cut this out completely… and have stuck to it.

This was made easier because I like coffee and was pleasantly surprised by Tim’s advice that it’s good for you! So I now have no OJ but two strong black-ish coffees with breakfast.

Food-wise I continued eating the granola I had every morning but started cutting back on the excess and introducing more nuts, seeds and proper yoghurt. 

However I’ve gone on to switch up my breakfast a bit more. I now make a breakfast of eggs (poached, scrambled or omelette) with seeded toast on the days I’m working from home. Often I’ll have that with oily fish like mackerel. Along with my coffees it’s so tasty – I love it! It fuels me for the morning really well. I enjoy making it, too.
