Growing up, I recall my Dad often used the old Scots phrase _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ and I’ve always loved it. It’s about the value of taking care of the little things because if you keep it up you get something bigger. 

And it’s true. For example over the last six months I’ve made lots of small life changes and I’m feeling an overall benefit.

## Where I started

I’s interesting to reflect on what was happening in my life prior to making these tweaks. Although there was no particular emergency there were a number of lower-level flags.

- I’d taken days off work for stress and mental fatigue triggered by aspects of my job. I often became frustrated by work
- I was pretty obsessive – work projects, web trends, supposedly fun hobbies – you name it. My OCD-like symptoms lead to paralysis and were mentally draining
- My life felt disorganised; cluttered and messy
- I suffered bouts of low mood which affected aspects of personal and home life. I felt tired and disconnected.
- I was getting my priorities wrong which wasn’t fair on those closest to me
- I often stayed up late then struggling to get up, with knock-on effects for the rest of my day.
- During and after lockdown, partly as a result of working from home, I’d developed bad habits. I would only just start work on time each day but without having eaten properly. I would dress lazily due to lack of time and organisation.
- I was overweight, and probably drinking a little more than I should when socialsing.

I guess _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ works in the negative direction too. These smaller unwanted issues combined to form a wider malaise. That’s where I was.

## Eating better

It was while on holiday last August with time to reflect and freshen things up that I started making changes. Clair told me about scientist and author [Tim Spector’s ideas about diet, avoiding harmful blood sugar spikes, and gut health](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/25/eat-fibre-first-and-ditch-the-juice-five-quick-and-easy-tips-for-a-much-healthier-meal). Until then I’d thought it was relatively healthy to drink a glass of Tropicana every morning, and did so for years. Upon learning the short and long term sugar-related impacts I decided to cut this out completely… and have stuck to it.

I was pleasantly surprised by Tim’s advice that coffee is good for you! So I now have no OJ but two strong black-ish coffees with breakfast.

Food-wise I now tend to make a breakfast of eggs (poached, scrambled or omelette) with seeded toast on days when I’m working from home. I’ll often combine that with oily fish like mackerel. Along with my coffee it’s so tasty – I love it! And it really fuels me for the morning ahead. I still sometimes eat granola but have cut back on the amount and the sugary varieties, introducing more nuts, seeds and proper yoghurt.

## Action first (thing in the morning)

I used to hit the snooze button on my alarm clock every morning – a terrible habit. It made me late which is a bad start to the day. Appparently the start-stop-start action also plays badly with your brain and your chances of productivity that day.

[Listening to Mel Robbins](https://www.tiktok.com/@feedambition/video/7334760705893108997) helped me realise that I can exert control over this kinda impulse and [change this bad habit](https://youtu.be/HSn-L9IXbOY?si=xuKuSsGqdbgfH_N0&t=846).

Since deciding to stop hitting the snooze button several months back, I’ve got up straight away _every single day_. 

It’s a small but mighty change, this one, which feels less about alarm clocks and more generally about better self-awareness and decision-making. And since it gets me up sharp, I often do a short workout too, helping keep me in better shape.

## Self-respect

I realised that although in years gone by I dressed smartly for work, I had drifted into lazier habits. I think this was partly a legacy of the Covid situation and home-working becoming the norm,. I’d do the morning dog walk and stay in the same clothes, or just default to a hoody. Dressing like this for work even when working from home didn’t make make me feel particularly good.

I should say that I don’t care how people choose to dress; if they’re comfortable and happy, great. But equally I’ve always admired people who dress well. And I know I personally feel happier and more confident when I make an effort.

So I started to better organise and look after my clothes. I retired some old stuff and bought a few new things. I earmarked some work outfits so I’d look more put-together, less thrown-together. I started to choose and lay out clothes the night before work, as a wee courtesy to my future self.

The overall effect is that I feel I now show myself (and my work) a bit more respect.

## Taking sleep seriously

In order to have enough pre-work time for a decent dog-walk and to eat well, I needed an earlier start. And to avoid that urge to snooze the alarm, I needed to be well rested. 

So I started going to bed for 10pm. I stopped taking my phone into the bedroom. I allowed twenty minutes reading time because it helps my brain wind down naturally. 

This particular change has been brilliant and really impactful. 

Recently I’ve noticed a couple of old habits creeping back in – for example messing about on the internet ‘til the last minute, or taking my laptop (rather than my phone) into bed. But I’ve quickly recognised that these are not conducive to a good night’s sleep so I’m quitting those too.

## A happier workspace

In winter 2023, Harry Roberts posted an image of [his new workspace](https://images.app.goo.gl/zbdf8LrAir5ooCzS8). It struck me how lean and clean it looked and how that elegance and lack of clutter must be doing wonders for his state of mind at work. So I made some changes to my own. It didn’t take long and it’s now a small source of joy each home-working day.
