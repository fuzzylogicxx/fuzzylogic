Growing up, I often heard my Dad use the old Scottish phrase _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ and I’ve always loved it. It’s about the value of taking care of the little things because if you keep doing that they combine for something bigger and more important. 

And it’s true. For example over the last six months I’ve made lots of small changes to how I live and I’m feeling a wider benefit.

## Where I started

It’s worth relating what was going on in my life prior to making these tweaks. Although there wasn’t any particular emergency there were a number of lower-level flags.

- I’d taken days off work for stress and mental fatigue triggered by aspects of my job. And I often became frustrated by work.
- I was obsessing about everything – work projects, web trends, supposedly fun hobbies – you name it. My OCD-like symptoms lead to paralysis and were mentally draining.
- My life felt disorganised; cluttered and messy.
- I suffered bouts of low mood which affected aspects of personal and home life. I felt tired and disconnected.
- I was getting my priorities wrong which wasn’t fair on those closest to me.
- I was often late to bed and struggling to rise, with knock-on effects for the rest of my day.
- During and after lockdown, partly as a result of working from home, I’d developed bad habits. I just about started work on time each day however I wouldn’t have eaten properly, and would dress lazily due to lack of time and organisation.
- I was overweight, and probably drinking a little more than I should on nights out.

I guess _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ works in the negative direction too. A number of smaller unwanted feelings and habits combine to form a wider malaise. That’s where I was.

## Eating better

It was while on holiday last August with time to reflect and freshen things up that I started making changes. Clair told me about scientist and author [Tim Spector’s ideas about diet, avoiding harmful blood sugar spikes, and gut health](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/25/eat-fibre-first-and-ditch-the-juice-five-quick-and-easy-tips-for-a-much-healthier-meal). Until then I’d thought it was relatively healthy to drink a glass of Tropicana every morning, and hadd done so for years. Upon learning the short and long term sugar-related impacts I decided to cut this out completely… and have stuck to it.

This was made easier because I like coffee and was pleasantly surprised by Tim’s advice that it’s good for you! So I now have no OJ but two strong black-ish coffees with breakfast.

Food-wise I continued with granola but cut back on the amount and introduced more nuts, seeds and proper yoghurt. However I’ve since switched it up a bit more and now make a breakfast of eggs (poached, scrambled or omelette) with seeded toast on the days I’m working from home. Often I’ll have that with oily fish like mackerel. Along with my coffees it’s so tasty – I love it! It really fuels me for the morning ahead. I enjoy making it, too.

## Action first (thing in the morning)

I used to hit the snooze button on my alarm clock every morning – a terrible habit. It made me late which is a bad start to the day. My understanding is that it’s also pretty bad for being productive that day due to the start-stop-start affects your brain.

[Listening to Mel Robbins](https://www.tiktok.com/@feedambition/video/7334760705893108997) helped me realise that being able to exert control over this kinda impulse is a valuable skill, and that I could [change this bad habit](https://youtu.be/HSn-L9IXbOY?si=xuKuSsGqdbgfH_N0&t=846).

Since deciding to stop hitting the snooze button several months back, I’ve got up straight away _every single day_. I think there’s a “count backwards from 5” technique you can use to help, but I haven’t even needed it.

It’s a small but mighty change, this one, which feels less about alarm clocks and more generally about better self-knowledge, discipline and decision-making. And I feel much better for it.

## Smartening up

I don’t care what people wear; if they’re comfortable and happy, I’m happy. By the same token I also appreciate people who dress well, and feel better and more confident when I make an effort myself.

I realised that although I once dressed smartly for work I had drifted into lazier habits. I was starting work wearing clothes that were fine for the morning dog walk but didn’t make me feel good at work.

So I started to organise and look after my clothes a bit better. I sold some old stuff and bought a couple of new things. I earmarked a few work outfits so I’d look more put-together and less thrown-together. I also supported myself time-wise by starting to lay out work clothes the night before, especially before mornings where I had an early commute to Edinburgh.

I now feel like I show myself and the day ahead a bit more respect.

## Taking sleep seriously

It was now clear that in order to have time to shower, walk Rudy, dress properly and eat well I needed to get up earlier. And to avoid feeling tired when that early alarm goes off, I needed to be well rested.

I started going to bed for 10pm. I put the phone outside the bedroom. I read for twenty minutes because it helps my brain calm down.
