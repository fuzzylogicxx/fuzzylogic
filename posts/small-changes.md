Growing up, I often heard my Dad use the old Scottish phrase _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ and I’ve always loved it. It means that combining lots of little things is worthwhile because collectively they form a bigger, more important thing.

It seems to be true in ways I hadn’t even considered. Over the last six months I’ve been making lots of small tweaks to how I live. It’s a work in progress but I’m seeing wider improvements and feeling better for it.

## My starting point

It’s worth relating what was going on in my life prior to making these tweaks. While there wasn’t any particular emergency there were a number of lower-level flags.

- I had recently taken days off work for stress and mental fatigue triggered by the nature of my job.
- I obsessed about things, both work-related matters and hobbies. These OCD-like symptoms were counterproductive and mentally draining.
- I suffered bouts of low mood which affected aspects of personal and home life. I felt tired and disconnected.
- I was often late to bed and struggling to rise, with knock-on effects for other parts of my day.
- During and after lockdown (and partly as a result of working from home) I’d developed bad habits. I was just about ready for work in time at the start of each day but without always eating well, and having dressed pretty lazily due to lack of time and organisation.
- I was a bit overweight.

I guess many _mony a mickle maks a muckle_ works both ways! A collection of smaller undesirable things leads to a larger sensation of things being off-kilter.

## Healthier breakfast

I think the idea with holidays is that you unwind completely, but pervesely I like devoting some holiday time to life admin. The change of scenery, relaxed mind and extra time lends an opportunity and perspective I don’t have normally. And it was while on holiday last year that I made the first small change. 

Clair told me about scientist and author [Tim Spector’s ideas about diet, avoiding harmful blood sugar spikes, and gut health](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/apr/25/eat-fibre-first-and-ditch-the-juice-five-quick-and-easy-tips-for-a-much-healthier-meal).

I’d been drinking a glass of Tropicana every morning for as long as I can remember – more than ten years for sure. I have now cut this out completely.

Something that made this easier is that I now enjoy coffee and read that it’s good for you! So I now have no OJ but two coffees with breakfast.

Food-wise I started by cutting back on excess granola, watching which type I bought and introducing more nuts, seeds and proper yoghurt. But I’ve since switched up the breakfast a bit more.

I now make a breakfast of eggs (poached, scrambled or omelette) with seeded toast on the days I’m working from home. Often I’ll have that with oily fish like Mackerel. Along with my coffees it’s so tasty – I love it! And it starts the day really well.

## Get a good sleep
