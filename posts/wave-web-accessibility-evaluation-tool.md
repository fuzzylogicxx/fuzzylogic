The featured article in this week’s [Accessibility Weekly newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/e7e43e8d6906/accessibility-weekly-161significant-wave-updates-and-more) was on recent improvements to the _WAVE_ suite of accessibility testing tools. 

I can’t remember using WAVE before, however just one quick test of [fuzzylogic.me](https://fuzzylogic.me) using their online tool revealed an accessibility issue with the linked SVG logo in the header. A great catch, now fixed, from which I learned something new. I’ll certainly be adding WAVE to my accessibility testing toolbox from here on in.

> WAVE is a suite of evaluation tools that help authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content. Our philosophy is to focus on issues that we know impact end users, facilitate human evaluation, and to educate about web accessibility.
