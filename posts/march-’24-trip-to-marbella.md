It’s been great to have a change of scenery, a wee bit of sun and some downtime.

I caught up on some listening: [Cillian Murphy on Desert Island Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001w72b), [Adam Buxton interviewing George Monbiot](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/rhwkafw2z2x3xe6-6ysb3-pfp9n-6xxa2-jnpn5-2cacw) (I’ve since resolved to buy Monbiot’s book _Regenesis_) and some excellent Gilles Petersen shows, firstly in interview with Michael Franks and secondly an amazing [feature on J Dilla with Pete from BBE](https://www.mixcloud.com/musiclover1980/gilles-peterson-2024-02-10-pete-bbe-on-j-dilla/). The latter includes a lovely old mixtape from Dilla. I love how he just roughly chopped in the main hooks of tunes in a way that’s low on polish and high on fun.

things fall apart, the smile,

Watched The Creator on Doug’s advice, which was fun. A bit of Curb, some [Shogun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788316/).

As always, every day I took a long walk along the Paseo Maritimo (the promenade that looks right onto the sea, Gibraltar and Morocco in the distance). With its scenery and mix of walkers, cyclists, dogs and restaurants that makes me feel happy and well. A couple of the days I took a detour to [Buena Vida](https://buenavidamarbella.es/) for a breakfast wrap and coffee. There’s a Scottish guy working there – he’s from Shetland if memory serves me rightly.
