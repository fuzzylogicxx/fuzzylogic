It’s been great to have a change of scenery, a wee bit of sun and some downtime.

I caught up on some listening: [Cillian Murphy on Desert Island Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001w72b), Jon Ronson’s [Things Fall Apart](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m0011cpr), [Adam Buxton interviewing George Monbiot](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/rhwkafw2z2x3xe6-6ysb3-pfp9n-6xxa2-jnpn5-2cacw) (I’ve since resolved to buy Monbiot’s book _Regenesis_) and some excellent Gilles Petersen shows, firstly in interview with Michael Franks and secondly an amazing [feature on J Dilla with Pete from BBE](https://www.mixcloud.com/musiclover1980/gilles-peterson-2024-02-10-pete-bbe-on-j-dilla/). The latter includes a lovely old mixtape from Dilla. I love how he just roughly chopped in the main hooks of tunes in a way that’s low on polish and high on fun. 

Also on the headphones were _The Smile_ – both their 6 Music Artists in residence sessions ([Johnny G playing Pain](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001whx3) was a highlight) and their new-ish album _Wall of Eyes_ which is great.


As always, every day I took a long walk along the Paseo Maritimo (the promenade that looks right onto the sea, Gibraltar and Morocco in the distance). With its scenery and mix of walkers, cyclists, dogs and restaurants that makes me feel happy and well. A couple of the days I took a detour to [Buena Vida](https://buenavidamarbella.es/) for a breakfast wrap and coffee. There’s a Scottish guy working there – he’s from Shetland if memory serves me rightly.

After my daily walk I enjoyed chilling on the balcony. I even allowed myself a wee afternoon glass of wine while listening to some music and – ain’t gonna lie – that is a nice thing to do to relax on your holiday.

When hanging out in the apartment on my own at night I watched [The Creator](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11858890/) which was fun, a bit of Curb your enthusiasm (final season) and some [Shogun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788316/).

Food-wise, when I was on my own I kept it simple with dinners at Venta las Pacos – they do stuff like Supa de Mariano, pepper steak + chips and flan. It’s cheap as chips and full of locals arriving after their work. Cibo is also decent, the Hamberguesa Casera at [Asador Nagüeles](https://asadornagueles.com/) is banging and there’s a wee joint (name escapes me) near the harbour where I had a cheap but perfect morning coffee and croissant and could just enjoy watching people go by.

[Restaurante el cortijo](https://elcortijoestepona.com/menu/) – no tapas!!!  No pizza, pasta!!! Downpour. Home made apple cake, crème brûlée. monkfish clams prawns in almond almost curry sauce from great grandmother. Beautiful Tempranillo wine. Beef/ham. Tuna tataki. Patatas bravos. /
