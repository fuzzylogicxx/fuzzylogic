It’s been great to have a change of scenery, a wee bit of sun and some downtime.

I caught up on some listening: [Cillian Murphy on Desert Island Discs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001w72b), Jon Ronson’s [Things Fall Apart](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m0011cpr), [Adam Buxton interviewing George Monbiot](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/rhwkafw2z2x3xe6-6ysb3-pfp9n-6xxa2-jnpn5-2cacw) (I’ve since resolved to buy Monbiot’s book _Regenesis_) and some excellent Gilles Petersen shows, firstly in interview with Michael Franks and secondly an amazing [feature on J Dilla with Pete from BBE](https://www.mixcloud.com/musiclover1980/gilles-peterson-2024-02-10-pete-bbe-on-j-dilla/). The latter includes a lovely old mixtape from Dilla. I love how he just roughly chopped in the main hooks of tunes in a way that’s low on polish and high on fun. 

Also on the headphones were _The Smile_ – both their [6 Music Artists in residence sessions](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001whx3) and their new album _Wall of Eyes_ which is great.

As always, every day I took a long walk along the Paseo Maritimo (the promenade that looks right onto the sea, Gibraltar and Morocco in the distance). With its scenery and mix of walkers, cyclists, dogs and restaurants this walk always makes me feel relaxed and happy. A couple of the days I took a detour to [Buena Vida](https://buenavidamarbella.es/) for a tasty breakfast wrap and coffee. There’s a Scottish guy working there – he’s from Shetland if memory serves me rightly.

After my daily walk I enjoyed chilling on the balcony and occasionally even snuck in a wee afternoon glass of vino while listening to some music. Ain’t gonna lie – that is a nice way to relax on your holiday.

When hanging out in the apartment on my own at night I watched [The Creator](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11858890/) which was fun, a bit of Curb your enthusiasm (final season) and some [Shogun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788316/).

Food-wise, when on my own I kept it simple with dinners at Venta las Pacos – they do stuff like Supa de Mariano and pepper steak with chips. It’s cheap as chips and full of locals arriving post-work. Cibo is also decent, the Hamberguesa Casera at [Asador Nagüeles](https://asadornagueles.com/) is banging and there’s a wee joint (name escapes me) near the harbour where I had a cheap but perfect morning coffee and croissant and could just enjoy watching people pass by going about their business.

Once Mark arrived we took a walk into the old town and, during a downpour, decided to try [Restaurante El Cortijo](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187439-d1527668-Reviews-Restaurant_El_Cortijo-Marbella_Costa_del_Sol_Province_of_Malaga_Andalucia.html). They make it clear from their signage outside that they serve authentic Andalusian food and “no tapas, pizza or pasta!!!”. And it was great. We had monkfish clams with prawns in an almond (almost curry-like) sauce – the owner’s great grandma’s recipe, washed down with beautiful Tempranillo wine. With the weater atrocious we decided to also treat ourselves to dessert: Home made apple cake, and crème brûlée. I’ll be back!

Clair was next to arrive. The three of us paid a visit to [the Trocadero](https://grupotrocadero.com/en/trocadero-beach/) for late lunch. We had delicious clams, chicken salad and even curry, with a glass of Marques de Riscal Verdejo which definitely hit the spot. It’s a great place.

On the Sunday three of us visited [Kala Kuala Chiringuito](https://kalakalua.com/es) in San Pedro for another seafood special – more clams, this time with paella. It was then the long-ish walk home along the Paseo Maratimo where we were merry enough to belt out a Pet Shop Boys medley, taking especial pleasure in saying “Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat” in the style of Neil Tennant. We stopped in at [Victors beach bar](https://www.instagram.com/victors_beach_1978/?hl=en) where DJ Luis was playing Kerri Chandler (I could recognise those beats from half a mile off!) and we got talking to him and his Londoner friend (another Laurence). That was a great wee vibe. To finish the night we played pool at [That’s Life](https://www.instagram.com/thats_life_marbella/) and did Scotland proud by emerging victorious over our Spanish rivals.

After Mark had left, Clair wanted to scratch her itch for Chinese food and we had a lovely meal at [Hong Kong restaurant](https://www.restaurantehk.com/).

Last thing to mention is that I am gradually learning more Spanish. I’m gonna keep going and see how far I can get. Vamos!
