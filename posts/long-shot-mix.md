A mix of electronic, house and techno records I recorded at home in November 2019.

2019 has been a fairly quiet year for my and [Tom’s](http://tomchurchill.com/) record label The Nuclear Family. However with a couple of winter events coming up I wanted to share a little teaser mix to whet the collective appetite.

## Inspiration
Earlier in the year I joined a fine bunch of pals on a night out at 69 at The Club, Paisley to hear resident DJs Martin and Euan plus a live performance from guest John Heckle. It was a fantastic night and particularly memorable for a couple of stellar tracks played by Euan. I tried to describe them to him afterwards but wasn’t sure if I was making much sense. Cut to a few months later and a mysterious parcel containing records I’ve never heard of arrives at my door. I was convinced that someone must have sent them to me in error until dropping the needle on the grooves and realising they were the tracks from that night at 69! Channeling Sherlock Holmes, I deduced that Euan – being the all-round good guy that he is – had bought and posted them to me as a souvenir of the night. What a guy!

And they are brilliant. 

The first is _Ricochet_ by Bambooman (a new name on me) on Matthew Herbert’s label, _Accidental Jnr_. It features a stuttering, percussive riff complimented by searing synth stabs – proper machine funk but with a heart. The second is a double-pack by the more familiar name of i:cube, with my favourite track _Fractal P_ a dark, winding, bass-heavy trip reminiscent of ’91 classic _Pressure Dub_ by Ability 11 but with its own distinct flavour. 

I knew I definitely wanted those tracks in the mix. 

Around those touchstones I added recent favourites from Joy O (under his Sin Falta alias), Phillip McGarva (the artist formerly known as Microworld) and Dego, plus a few oldies including Isolée’s _Hermelin_ and _Modern Tribe_ by Jellybean (AKA Glenn Underground).

In terms of kit, I recorded the mix on a pair of Technics 1210s and an [Isonoe 420 mixer](http://www.isonoe.com/products2/iso420-mixer/).
