In work, I’m often asked for accessibility guidelines or to help people who have less knowledge on the topic. I am most definitely not an accessibility expert however I have picked up lots of tips and knowledge since I began working on websites back in 2003. So I thought it’d be a handy resource if I collected my web accessibility guidelines, tips and tests in one place.
