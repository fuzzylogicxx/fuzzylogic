Here, [Mandy Michael](http://batmandy.com/) explores similar territory to [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) in suggesting that not all responsive pattern challenges require, or indeed are best served by, media queries. 

The example here is a pipe-separated text pair (I could imagine an _author_ and _publish date_ meta line) which Mandy wants to wrap (with pipe separator hidden) only when the content and container require it, rather than based on the less-relevant _viewport width_.

She uses a clever combination of `flex-wrap:wrap`, generated content, padding, `transform` and `overflow-y:hidden` to achieve her goal.
