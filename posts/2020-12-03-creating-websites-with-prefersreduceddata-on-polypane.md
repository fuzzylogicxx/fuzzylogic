I’ve long wondered if there could be a way to tailor content to a user based on the speed of their internet connection, especially when considering features like responsive images. This looks like it might be the way to do that (although browser support is currently non-existent). It also allows us to respect the user’s wishes on how much data / battery life etc they’re willing to spare for your website.
