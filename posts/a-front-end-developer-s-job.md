Recently I’ve been reflecting on what we front-end developers do in the modern era. Working on a design system in 2022, it feels now more than ever that my job embodies the convergence of a host of interesting goals, disciplines, skills and experiences. Yet not long ago a colleague recalled a previous teammate of his teasing him that front-end developers “put the froth on the cappuccino”. While this gave us all a laugh, I imagine it also reflects a fairly common misunderstanding and undervaluing of our role.

Meanwhile there’s another, newer image of front-end development that is very JavaScript-oriented and arose in this era of JavaScript dependency management and JavaScript frameworks. In this definition, front-end developers spend their time wrangling JavaScript, configuring build tools and manipulating API data. For some developers that’s no doubt the case! I’m conscious of [the great divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/) and freely admit I’m [a front of the front-ender](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development/).

Description of a “Design System engineer” (for a job application form) that I suggested:

- Very strong knowledge and understanding of the core web standards: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Strong appreciation of the need for appropriate HTML semantics to achieve resilience and accessibility
- Understands component-based architecture and delivery including concepts like atomic design, composition, variants and versioning
- Advanced understanding of web accessibility including how to create accessible interactive components
- Excellent attention to detail in implementing designs in code
- Strong appreciation of responsive / multi-device considerations
- Comfortable in modern CSS including BEM-like methodologies, ITCSS architecture, and modern approaches such as Flexbox, CSS Grid, custom properties
- Competence in testing JavaScript and Ruby-based components
- Git
- Committed to constantly learning and improving technical knowledge and skills

Here are some of the key areas I find myself working in from day-to-day.

## Accessibility

I list this first not due to alphabetical order, but because it’s arguably the cornerstone of our job, for two reasons. Firstly, because the web was designed to be accessible to all therefore it’s incumbent on us to uphold that. (Of course it’s not just _our_ job, however we tend to be both the primary evangelists and last line of defence). Secondly, so many other aspects of front-end development can only be done well when you start from an accessible foundation. This is something that becomes clearer and clearer the longer you do this job.

## Resilience

Words.

## Performance

Words.

## Adaptability

Did I mean responsiveness here? Can change to whatever I want :-)

## Scalability, 

At scale, you can’t just write new code for everything. You need to write  Can your component be used X Y Z

## Maintainability and sustainability

## DS factors

Componentization. 

Creating component APIs.

Composition.

Documentation.

## integration in company framework (can be annoying). 

Words

## UX

words

## Sometimes making it interactive.

## Making it look good.

Now full disclosure, when it comes to the great divide I’m definitely a _front of the front end_ developer and I’ve also been doing this long before React and co. appeared on the scene… so admittedly I’m biased! But even still, w
