_Several People are Solving_ is a lovely [React app](https://github.com/zetter/react-crossword) which started as a fork of The Guardian’s _Frontend_ repo in order to further develop their crossword component.

See author [Chris Zetter’s article](https://chriszetter.com/blog/2018/12/02/multiplayer-crosswords/) on how he then introduced WebSockets (within a Rails application) to facilitate real-time collaboration.

The crosswords are updated regularly so what are you waiting for? [Get solving!](https://multicrosser.chriszetter.com/)
