A lovely app [built in React](https://chriszetter.com/blog/2018/12/02/multiplayer-crosswords/) from a fork of The Guardian’s _Frontend_ repo which extended [their crossword component](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/tree/3bff64c9093be3fae823eb7c1b5572d777fbf2ef/static/src/javascripts/projects/common/modules/crosswords), introducing WebSockets to facilitate real-time collaboration.
