A couple of weeks ago I was kindly asked to provide a guest DJ mix for the Vic’s Sunday Soundclash show on Radio Magnetic.

You can [listen to the show](https://www.mixcloud.com/RadioMagnetic/vics-sunday-soundclash-08-w-laurence-hughes/) on demand.

Here’s the tracklist for my mix:

* Black Uhuru - Chill Out
* Jackie Mittoo - Oboe
* Joe Higgs - There’s A Reward For Me
* UBrown - Me Chat You Rock
* Riddim Tuffa ft OBF - Food Dub Ninja
* Mosca - Prento
* The Royals - My Sweat Turns To Blood
* Tatham/Ranks/Lord/Mensah - Private Life
* Freddie McGregor w/ Sound Dimension - Africa Here I Come
* Carlton Patterson w/King Tubby - King At The Controls
* King Tubby - Herbal Dub
* Carlton Coffie - Chant Away
* Fabian - Prophecy
* Prophecy Dub

I really enjoyed the chance to pull together reggae, dub and dancefloor favourites (old and new) for the mix. Cheers for the invite, Vicky!

You can catch Vic’s Sunday Soundclash on the first Sunday of each month at 2pm on [Radio Magnetic](https://www.radiomagnetic.com/).
