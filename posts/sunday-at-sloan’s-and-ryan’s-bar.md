Hung out with Jason and Lydia, Aldo and Anna today at Sloan’s bar in town. It was a good day – I hadn’t seen the former two for a while and know they’ve had a rough time of late due to a death in the family. They were in good spirits and we enjoyed tasty but well-priced food and drinks. I had Venison Stew, having loved it so much on that recent excursion to Wild Kabn.

Meanwhile I was delighted to hear that Aldo and Anna had bumped into our friends Doug and Zoe while on holiday recently and had all hung out. 

We spent a happy hour or two shooting the breeze. At the end, I went on with Jason and Lydia to Ryan’s Bar in the southside. That’s my third time there; it’s a cool wee spot with a good drinks selection. I was pretty envious of Jason’s margarita.
