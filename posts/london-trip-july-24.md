I had a fantastic time in London last weekend.
---

When my pal Mark visited Glasgow in May for The Queen’s Park Weekender he asked if I’d like to join him on his [Soulsaver boat party](https://ra.co/events/1866753) in July – maybe even to play some records. Since I hadn’t visited him down south for a while I gratefully accepted and put it in the calendar.

## Thursday

I left on Thursday morning having bought a cheaper train ticket using [Avanti Superfare.](https://www.avantisuperfare.co.uk/) That night, after a stroll through a buzzing Chinatown I met Rob, Kirsty, Johnnie and Kate for dinner at [Machiya](https://www.machi-ya.co.uk/). We had a great little meal. My highlights were the Nasu Dengaku (miso-glazed aubergine), Broccoli Itame, Pork Katsudon Donburi and the lovely low-alc Hitachino Ginger Lager.

After dinner we went to the ICA (Institute for Contemporary Arts) to check [10 Years of Wisdom Teeth](https://www.ica.art/live/wisdom-teeth) which featured Facta & K-LONE (live), Tristan Arp (live) and Surgeon’s Girl (live). We all enjoyed this although I reckon the music might have flowed a little better if the sequence of acts were reversed. Still, nice venue, nice gig and I also enjoyed their [Sunshine Kölsch lager](https://thegoodnessbrew.co/products/sunshine-kolsch-lager-4-7). Afterwards, we walked together for a bit then when Jonnie and Kate caught the tube at Leicester Square I powered on home. I love walking around cities.

## Friday

With a free schedule, my plan was a blissful day of walking, soaking up summer vibes and popping into various record and clothes shops. I’d head southeast from my hotel’s location at Russell Square to Spittalfields then make a beeline north to Stoke Newington via Hoxton and Dalston. 

I started by heading along Clerkenwell Rd. I took a turn at Old Street onto Goswell Rd for a brief detour to see The Barbican Centre. The surrounding area really is a concrete jungle to get lost in. It’s kinda otherwordly! I enjoyed that and am now keen to go to a gig there.

Next, I headed for breakfast at [The Breakfast Club, Spitalfields](https://thebreakfastclubcafes.com/spitalfields/). I enjoyed some turkish eggs and a nice americano while reading about an unfolding [global IT collapse.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp4wnrxqlewo). From there it was on to some shops in and around the Spitalfields Market – [Goodhood](https://goodhoodstore.com/), YMC and the like. It’s cool around there!

Fuelled up and ready to go, I started walking through Shoreditch. Clair had recommended I eat at [Smoking Goat](https://www.smokinggoatbar.com/) and although it was bad timing to pass by as I was full, I peered in the window, saw it looked lovely inside and with dishes like _Masaman Smoked Short Rib_ on the menu, I’ll be back. I kept walking up Kingsland Road, stopping in at [Sneakersnstuff](https://www.sneakersnstuff.com/) then to grab a coffee at [Moko Made](https://www.instagram.com/mokomadecafe/?hl=en), a lovely little Japanese café. 

By now I had reached one of my planned stops – [Love Vinyl](https://www.instagram.com/lovevinyllondon/) in Dalston. I’ve been before and it’s a crate-digger’s dream. This time round I dug out and listened to a whole bunch of different reggae, house and disco. I also really enjoyed the sounds in the shop as they played through a new second-hand collection. Jean-Luc Ponty’s _Computer Incantations for World Peace_ sounded particularly nice through their Bozak ar-4 and Void speakers set-up as the afternoon sun shone through the windows. In the end I picked up some vintage New Jersey house from Larry Rauson and Cassio, a Janet Davis UK 12 on a Lover’s Rock tip and Unique’s What I got is what you need (which had been on the wants list for aeons – likely since the time I realised [it’s the sample source for 808 State’s Ancodia](https://www.whosampled.com/sample/165580/808-State-Ancodia-Unique-What-I-Got-Is-What-You-Need/)).
