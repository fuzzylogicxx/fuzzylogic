I had a fantastic time in London last weekend.

When my pal Mark visited Glasgow in May for The Queen’s Park Weekender he asked if I’d like to join him on his Soulsaver boat party in July – maybe even to play some records – and since I hadn’t caught him down south for a while I gratefully accepted and put it in the calendar.


## Thursday


I left on Thursday morning having bought a cheaper train ticket using [Avanti Superfare.](https://www.avantisuperfare.co.uk/) That night, after a stroll through a buzzing Chinatown I met Rob, Kirsty, Johnnie and Kate for dinner at [Machiya](https://www.machi-ya.co.uk/). We had a great little meal. My highlights were the Nasu Dengaku (miso-glazed aubergine), Broccoli Itame, Pork Katsudon Donburi and the lovely low-alc Hitachino Ginger Lager.


After dinner we went to the ICA (Institute for Contemporary Arts) to check [10 Years of Wisdom Teeth](https://www.ica.art/live/wisdom-teeth) which featured Facta & K-LONE (live), Tristan Arp (live) and Surgeon’s Girl (live). We all enjoyed this although I reckon the music might have flowed a little better if the sequence of acts were reversed. Still, nice venue, nice gig and I also enjoyed their [Sunshine Kölsch lager](https://thegoodnessbrew.co/products/sunshine-kolsch-lager-4-7). Afterwards, we walked together for a bit then when Jonnie and Kate caught the tube at Leicester Square I powered on home. I love walking around cities.


## Friday


With a free schedule, my plan was a blissful day of walking, soaking up summer vibes and popping into various record and clothes shops. I’d head southeast from my hotel’s location at Russell Square to Spittalfields then make a beeline north to Stoke Newington via Hoxton and Dalston. 


I started by heading along Clerkenwell rd. I took a brief detour around The Barbican Centre. The surrounding area really is a concrete jungle you can get lost in. It’s kinda otherwordly! I enjoyed it and am now keen to go to a gig there.


I kept walking to Spitalfields via Old St and Finsbury square. Breakfast club turkish eggs and nice americano. 


Goodhood.

Nice dark denim shirt at Sunspel on redchurch st. Folk’s trousers are quite nice, but bit of a luxury I don’t need. 


Hoxton.
