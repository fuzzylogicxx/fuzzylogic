Main points:

Never Rely On Color Alone. Your error message should be clear on its own and itâ€™s a good idea to also draw attention via an appropriate icon such as an exclamation mark inside a circle.

As well as error messages beside the problem input, also provide a summary of errors at the top of the page.
