Today was a nice break from the old routine. Rather than working at a computer, I and some teammates went to Edinburgh’s Western General Hospital to do some gardening. 

My employer supports the charity [FACE](https://www.face.scot/) (Fighting Against Cancer Edinburgh), part of NHS Lothian Charity. 

> FACE provides the ‘little things’ which can make a real difference for patients undergoing treatment for cancer. These things help make the time spent in hospital as comfortable as possible; the environment and experience as positive as it can be.

Our job today was to tidy the area surrounding the FACE garden. The garden serves as a quiet outdoor space where patients, visitors and staff can find solace away from the hospital wards.

Supervised by the conservation charity [TCV](https://www.tcv.org.uk/), we tooled up and set about weeding the garden and paved areas. It was a sunny day, we chatted while we worked to colleagues we hadn’t met, and by the end you could see we had made a significant dent.

I hope we made a small difference and I certainly enjoyed doing it and would do so again. Thanks to my employer for the opportunity.
