Here are my current go-to resources when building a new site using Eleventy (11ty).
--- 

[Build an Eleventy site from scratch](https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3) by Stephanie Eckles. As the name suggests, this is for starting from a blank canvas. It includes a really simple and effective way of setting up a Sass watch-and-build pipeline that runs alongside that of Eleventy, using only `package.json` scripts rather than a bundler.

[Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) from 11ty. If rather than a blank canvas you want a boilerplate that includes navigation, a blog, an RSS feed and prism CSS for code block styling (among other things) then this is a great option. Of course, you can also just cherry-pick the relevant code you need, as I often do.

[Eleventy Navigation Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/). This allows you to set a page or post as a navigation item. It handily supports ordering and hierarchical nesting (for subnavigation). You can then render out your navigation from a layout in a one-liner or in a custom manner.

[Eleventy Cache Assets Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/cache/). This is really handy for caching fetched data so as not to exceed API limits or do undue work on every build.

More to followâ€¦
