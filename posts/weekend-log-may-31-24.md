This Saturday morning I enjoyed a walk on Tinto Hill with Rudy. It’s a medium-level climb and the weather was decent. Although there were lots of other dogs they mostly gave us space. 

Later, Clair and I went to No. 10 down the road to meet Mark, then Sophie and Anya. I had an interesting chat with Sophie where it turns out that some of the coaching techniques I’ve been learning at work (active listening, asking questions rather than providing solutions etc) are things Sophie does all the time in hers as an educational psychologist.

We continued on to the Stag and Thistle where we were joined by Tom, Lou and wee James. They’re still having bother finding a flat here but hopefully not for much longer. Craig and Alan soon joined but I couldn’t chat to them for long before leaving.

A short hill-walk with my main dog-pal followed by a catch-up with friends makes for a good Saturday.
