These days when friends tell me they want a personal website, it’s often just a single-page profile that they’re really after rather than something pricier and more complicated. In the past there were services like [http://flavors.me/](http://flavors.me/) but it seems to have gone by the wayside. This looks like a decent option to point friends toward if they’re not looking for a blog or want to take baby steps toward that. Incidentally, I came across Carrd through Chris Ferdinandi’s [Vanilla JS List](https://vanillajslist.com/) which features organisations which favour Vanilla JavaScript over JS frameworks.
