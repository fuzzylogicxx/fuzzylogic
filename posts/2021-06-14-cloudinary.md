Cloudinary is a very handy tool for image and video upload, storage, optimisation and CDN.

> Store, transform, optimize, and deliver all your media assets with easy-to-use APIs, widgets, or user interface.

This was brought to my attention by [@grigs](https://twitter.com/grigs) at An Event Apart. We were discussing his article series on Responsive Images and I asked if he could recommend a tool which auto-generated all of the images you needed for your responsive image code, if you provide a single source image.

Iâve been trying Cloudinary out and so far, so good. (via [@grigs](https://twitter.com/grigs))
