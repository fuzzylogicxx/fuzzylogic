This article is a couple of years old but just popped up on my radar again. Alex Chen asserts that arguments which pit accessibility against aesthetics create a dangerous false equivalence.

> The article claims that if we are âtoo accessibleâ we will meet the needs of the minority but end up hurting those of the majority. This creates a false equivalence between having legitimate access needs and having a preference for a certain aesthetic.
