I’ve just finished reading [Never Let Me Go](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Kazuo-Ishiguro/Never-Let-Me-Go/1518724) by Kazuo Isihiguro.

Afterwards I was also keen to see [the film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/), which I enjoyed. It featured great performances by Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in particular, and a haunting score. Although I enjoyed the book, I found it a little slow-paced and so watching the film helped bring it all together (despite taking a few liberties with the plot). 

Lastly, I enjoyed [this short interview with the author](https://youtu.be/_jCB59pPG7k) in which he interestingly remarked that the sci-fi element was just a device to support the primary topic of managing friendship and loving relationships within our short lifetimes.
