Every time I watch nostalgic TV documentaries about Scottish films I see _Just a Boys’ Game_ and _Just Another Saturday_ – both written by Peter McDougall – come up. I just watched _Just a Boys’ Game_ ([available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/tv/show?id=_bzLqTe-WRBxrpWy_fmy_A&cdid=tvseason-qaN9iaVu8JDd3aM-jtghkg&gdid=tvepisode-1zSwUxBSlf8)) and loved it. Set in 1979 Glasgow, this is a gritty story with refreshingly great acting which really captures the finer social and economic points of the mood at the time.
