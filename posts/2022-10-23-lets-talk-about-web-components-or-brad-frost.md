Brad breaks down the good, bad and ugly of web components but also makes a compelling argument that we should get behind this technology.

> I come from the Zeldman school of web standards, am a strong proponent of progressive enhancement, care deeply about accessibility, and want to do my part to make sure that the web lives up to its ideals. And I bet you feel similar. It’s in that spirit that I want to see web components succeed. Because web components are a part of the web!
