I currently buy books from a mix of physical and online stores including Waterstones, Hive, Blackwells and most recently, [The Outwith Agency](https://www.theoutwithagency.co.uk/) – my new local shop.

I have a [Bookshelf](https://fuzzylogic.me/bookshelf/) section of my website which lists a number of books I’ve read, including what I’m currently reading. The idea was very much inspired by [Dave Rupert’s bookshelf](https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/).

On my virtual bookshelf, each book links to a product details page on a third party website so that a visitor can easily buy that book if so inclined. This is a feature which I added without too much deeper thought.

On Dave Rupert’s bookshelf, each book links to its counterpart on Amazon. This is likely for two reasons: firstly, Amazon tend to have _everything_; and secondly, he is enrolled in Amazon’s affiliate scheme, so can make a small commission from each recommendation that leads to a purchase. Makes sense!

Even though I’m not an Amazon affiliate I started by linking to Amazon almost by default, until a few months ago when I began linking to [Hive](https://www.hive.co.uk/) instead. Upon hearing that Hive give a small percentage of each sale to an independent book shop I realised I’d rather support that effort than simply boost Amazon’s profits. (Also: Amazon don’t need my money, and I’m not a big fan of their attitude toward privacy).

Earlier this month [I heard about Bookshelf](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/2020-11-02-bookshop-this-is-revolutionary-on-the-guardian/) and their MO is even more attractive than Hive’s. They provide “ready-made storefront” functionality for independent bookshops, and when a customer buys from a specific shop that shop is given the *full profits* of each sale. Alternately customers can buy from the generic Bookstore store too, in which case the profits are evenly distributed among a pool of independent shops.

I think when I buy books online in future, if I’m not buying direct from a shop then I’ll buy from Bookshelf.

I’m also going to mention to The Outwith Agency about Bookshop. They don’t currently have an e-commerce store so this could be some low-hanging fruit.

I’ve also enrolled in Bookshop’s [affiliate programme](https://uk.bookshop.org/affiliates/profile/introduction) because it’s an attractive proposition:

> We also support anyone who advocates for books through our affiliate programme, which pays a 10% commission on every sale, and gives a matching 10% to independent bookshops.

Can’t argue with that! It feels like a pretty win-win way to recommend books.

As for my website: I’m now going to link any books I mention to the corresponding product on Bookshelf (I’ve already started with my note on [A Promised Land](https://fuzzylogic.me/posts/note-2020-10-25t16-00-58-barack-obama-a-promised-land/)) and see if I can’t take advantage of that affilliate scheme. I’ll need to do a little work on my Bookshelf page, however Bookshop helpfully use a consistent URL structure which includes each book’s ISBN so that should make it easier to template my links and thumbnails. 

Footnote: a big thank-you to Adactio’s post [Bookshop](https://adactio.com/journal/17596) which contains some great tips for setting up on Bookshop as I’ve discussed above.
