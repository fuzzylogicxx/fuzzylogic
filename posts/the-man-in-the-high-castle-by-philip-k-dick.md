The second Phillp K Dick I’ve read this year is his alternative-history sci-fi classic.

In this book, Dick protrays an alternate scenario where the Axis powers have won the second world and America is under the rule of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. 

Interestingly, many of the characters use the ancient Chinese text the _I Ching_ for guidance, and there’s also a clever “book within a book” subplot in which the book _The Grasshopper Lies Heavy_ depicts an alternate history in which the Allied forces prevailed.

Having now read a couple of Philip K. Dick books this year, I’m arriving at the conclusion that while I don’t love his writing style, this is compensated by his creativity and his ideas which stay with you long after you finish reading.
