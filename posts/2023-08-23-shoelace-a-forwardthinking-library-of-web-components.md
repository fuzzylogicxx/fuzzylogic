Iâm interested by Shoelaceâs MO as a collection of pre-rolled, customisable web components. The idea is that it lets individuals and teams start building with web components â i.e. in a framework-agnostic way â more quickly.

I guess itâs a kind of Bootstrap for web components? Iâm interested to see how well itâs done, how customisable the components are and how useful it is in real life. Or if nothing else, to see how theyâve build their components!

Definitely a nice idea.

I'll delve into Shoelace in the future  when I have more time, but in the meantime I very quickly knocked together a codepen that renders a Dropdown instance.
