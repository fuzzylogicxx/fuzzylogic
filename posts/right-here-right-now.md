Martin introduces the “Now” page concept and how he adapted it for showing on his homepage.

I quite like the _Now_ concept in general and have already starting tinkering with it. I also really like Martin’s neat, _front matter free_ solution in Eleventy and could see that being more widely reusable for me for other “light-touch collections”.
