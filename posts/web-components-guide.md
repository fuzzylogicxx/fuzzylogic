This new resource on Web Components from Keith Cirkel and Kristján Oddsson of GitHub (and friends) is looking great so far.

As [I recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/fuzzylogicx/status/1614202359520919553), I love that it’s demoing “vanilla” Web Components first rather than using a library for the demos. The various libraries (Lit etc) with their dependencies, opinions and proprietary syntaxes are really prevalent but aren’t yet my preferred approach while I’m still learning. They can make an already complicated subject feel more complicated, add overhead to my set-up and maintenance, and add abstractions at a point where actually I want to properly understand what’s going on at the web standards level.

Aside from tutorials there’s also a great [_Learn_](https://webcomponents.guide/learn/) section which digs into JavaScript topics such as Classes and Events and why these are important for Web Components.

I hope that in future the guide will cover testing Web Components too.

Lastly, I’m enjoying the Embed Mastodon Toot web component tutorial so far, and to help it sink in (and save the code for posterity) I’ve [chucked the code into a pen](https://codepen.io/fuzzylogicx/pen/RwBgveM).
