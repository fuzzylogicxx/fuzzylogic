This utility adds a banner to the bottom (or top) of your website, asking the visitor to explicitly give or decline consent for the cookies your website uses. It’s a great free resource which handles the requisite GDPR requirements (and more) and offers a number of customisation options.

We need this because cookies often collect information about their users that, while not specifically identified with one individual, could be combined with other data then used to identify an individual therefore becoming “personal information” for the purposes of the GDPR – and must be treated as such.
