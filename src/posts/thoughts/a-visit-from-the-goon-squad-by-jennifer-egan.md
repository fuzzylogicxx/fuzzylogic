I really enjoyed this book, recommended to me by [Gillian](https://twitter.com/Gilco80) and [Tom](https://twitter.com/mrtomchurchill).

It’s set primarily in New York and tells the stories of a cast of interconnected characters (and their children) linked by the music industry, taking in themes of youth and ageing, loss and regret, insecurity, celebrity and image.

There are some great moments including Rob’s story which called to mind [The Talented Mr Ripley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134119/); Jules’s unpublished and unhinged newspaper article on the celebrity interview which sent him to jail; and the dystopian final chapter which suggests where the internet and the world of influencers might be headed if we don’t watch out.

I loved author Jennifer Egan’s storytelling, dark humour and also the way she switched her writing style dependent on the era or character.

Recommended!
