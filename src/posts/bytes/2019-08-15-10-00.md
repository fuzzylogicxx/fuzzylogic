In second year a nice school pal introduced me to The Cure when I was on an otherwise strict diet of rave tapes. _Mixed Up_ with its dubby extended mixes sealed the deal. Shamefully haven’t yet seen them live so I’m at fever pitch for tomorrow’s gig at Bellahouston. Hopefully see some of you there!
