Just took delivery of this feast for the eyes and ears from Firecracker Recordings. Other Lands, Lord Of The Isles and friends on the sounds; House Of Traps and co. on the stellar artwork. Like the first release this was made in association with The Forestry Commission, is totally unique and I highly recommend [grabbing a copy](https://www.undergroundsolushn.com/music/music-top-picks/mac-talla-nan-creag-the-sorrow-of-derdriu-firecracker).
