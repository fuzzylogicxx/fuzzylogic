On reflection this one was pretty naive and raw but I can live with that! I was 25 when I made it and listening to a lot of [John Tejada](https://youtu.be/ZmJhs20Wkog), and you can definitely hear that influence alongside other typical Detroit Techno stylings.

I made it in Cubase with a combination of software and hardware. The main bassline sound came from NI Mercury, with an additional bassline from my Waldorf Pulse. The drums were programmed in Attack and the main riff with its panning effects was also software-based. The pad and portamento/gliding lead part came from my Juno 106 and Nord Lead 2 respectively.

Fun fact: the name _Ice 2 Go_ came from a night out in Amsterdam with label-boss Jason and the lovely Lydia during which we asked a bar for a bag of ice to take away to make _caipirinhas_. A mildly merry Jason first heard then signed the track that very night.

I remember that DJs like DJ 3000 and Nomadico/Dex from Underground Resistance played it. Closer to home I heard that Hudson Mohawke was a fan and played it at the Sub Club, while Jackmaster [was good enough to showcase it](https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tracks/n3zwc4) in a “lesser-known gems” feature on Radio 1. And nice people who I respect like [Mark](https://twitter.com/mthrmrk) still rate it, so that’s good enough for me.
